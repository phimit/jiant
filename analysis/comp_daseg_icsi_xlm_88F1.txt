|that 's a lot of overlap |yeah
That 's a lot of overlap ,| yeah ,
|and then i wanted to ask you just for my inter information |then would you be trai |cuz i don't quite unders |so would you be training then um the segmenter so that it could on the basis of that segment the rest of the meeting |so if i give you like five minutes is the idea that this would then be applied to uh to providing tighter time bands

|now the other que related question though is is uh what 's the boot models for these things

Yeah , yeah , yeah .
|yeah
Yeah .
|and i think it 's something mari can probably use in her preliminary report |that was the thing we talked about i think before the transcriber |like yeah we 're at the point where we 're training these classifiers |and we 're just reporting very preliminary but suggestive results that some features both word and pro prosodic work |the other thing that was interesting to me is that the pitch features are better than in switchboard |and i think that really is from the close talking mikes |cuz the pitch processing that was done has much cleaner behavior than than the switchboard telephone bandwidth

|their argument there was the lpc model fits the peaks of the spectrum |so it may be m naturally more robust in noise |and i thought well that makes sense |but so far we can't get much much out of it

|and it turns out that the longest words are actually the ones that do the best |so my guess about what 's happening is that you know if you assume a fixed the same amount of training data for each of these digits and a fixed length model for all of them but the actual words for some of them are half as long it works really well

|because anyway i i let me consi suggest that 's a s not a first order consideration |we have two first order considerations |which is what are the uh influences |a a and b how do they get combined mathematically how do we display them is an issue |but um
because| anyway I I let me consi suggest that 's a s not a first - order consideration ,| we have two first - order considerations| which is what are the uh influences A ,| A ,| and B how do they get combined mathematically ,| how do we display them is an issue ,| but| um
|so i mean there are things that in terms of like the time alignment issue
So , I mean , there are things that in terms of like the time alignment issue
|so w we will hafta worry about format
So , w we will hafta worry about format .
|again i 'm not sure how much i should talk about stuff before everyone 's here

|well they
Well they 
|i 'm just wondering now
I 'm just wondering now 
|sort of an equivalent

|mm hmm
Mm - hmm .
|oh it 's it 's wiener filtering
Oh , it 's it 's Wiener filtering .
|but i d i 'm sorry |does it still have the median filter stuff
But | i d I 'm sorry ,| does it still have the median filter stuff ?
|ok
OK .
|well why don't you have this have a this conversation with dave johnson tha rather than with me
Well , why don't you have this have a this conversation with Dave Johnson tha rather than with me ?
|so so when one person is speaking there 's breaks |whereas thilo 's won't have that
So so when one person is speaking , there 's breaks .| Whereas Thilo 's won't have that .
|there 's a lot of nice features to it |and it kinda helps to balance the load of the machines

|and there 's a there 's a script |and that is actually all in one script |so there 's this one script that parses waveform names |yeah
And there 's a there 's a script and that is actually all in one script .| So there 's this one script that parses waveform names| Yeah .
|right
Right .
|and and uh i i i but it 's the mean is an exponent of the whatever the the this gaussian function
And and uh i i i| but it 's the mean is an exponent of the whatever , the the this Gaussian function .
|chuck is getting himself in trouble
Chuck is getting himself in trouble .
|yeah |yeah
yeah ?| yeah ?

Right ?
|is |yeah
is | Yeah .
|eee |yeah
Eee ! Yeah .
|but that will depend on what the meeting 's about |right
But , that will depend on what the meeting 's about ,| right ?
|oh cube |yeah
Oh ! Cube . Yeah .
|yeah |yeah sometimes they p they usually put them in prethen parentheses |and you think to yourself you were way off
Yeah .| Yeah , sometimes they p they usually put them in prethen parentheses ,| and you think to yourself , " You were way off ,
|so what decisions does this make
So what decisions does this make ?
|all of all of these assume you know who 's speaking
all of all of these assume you know who 's speaking .
|so i mean again if you trained in one kind of noise and tested in the same kind of noise you 'd you know given enough training data you don't do b do badly
So , I mean , again , if you trained in one kind of noise and tested in the same kind of noise , you 'd you know , given enough training data you don't do b do badly .
|people in the meeting

|and um the any a measure that you have of how much of the energy is due to your best guess at a particular harmonic sequence it 's also going to be a smaller fraction |this is you know related to the harmonicity sort of thing
And um the any a measure that you have of how much of the energy is due to your best guess at a particular harmonic sequence , it 's also going to be a smaller fraction .| This is , you know , related to the harmonicity sort of thing .
|because it would be different depending on what your language is |so

|how do you get per i don't know the evil apostrophe
How do you get per I don't know the evil apostrophe .
|but you have to
but you have to 
|right |so um the p my point is that you 're gonna end up with uh word sequences that are differently annotated |and you want some tool uh that is able to sort of merge these different annotations back into a single uh version |ok |um and we had this problem very massively uh at sri when we worked uh a while back on uh well on dialogue acts as well as uh you know um what was it |uh
Right .| So ,| um ,| the p my point is that you 're gonna end up with , uh , word sequences that are differently annotated .| And you want some tool , uh , that is able to sort of merge these different annotations back into a single , uh , version .| OK ?| Um , and we had this problem very massively , uh , at SRI when we worked , uh , a while back on , uh well , on dialogue acts as well as , uh , you know ,| um , what was it ?| uh ,
|um and so i 'm starting to obtain alignments on these databases |um and the way i mi i do that is that i just use the htk system |but i train it only on the close talking microphone
Um | And so I 'm starting to obtain alignments on these databases .| Um , and the way I mi I do that is that I just use the HTK system but I train it only on the close - talking microphone .

|sudden surprising contact |ok |right
Sudden surprising contact ,| OK .| right ?
|it 's it 's uh like i don't know how i just transcribe it as i say like click

|mm hmm |mm hmm
Mm - hmm .| Mm - hmm .
|i i 'm sorry i don't understand your question
I I 'm sorry .| I don't understand your question .
|i think we 're already gonna |i mean there 's already some chance that different annotations different places |you know |but you can control that by knowing you 're making two corpora or knowing that you 're adding um annotations on one version and you don't have the latest corrections maybe at that point |and then you finish the project and you realize that there were corrections made on your originals |and then you have to merge them |and the b the thing that makes it ea ok to do that is knowing where the synch time boundaries are |cuz you can automatically pretty much merge things if you 've only got twenty words or so in an utterance it 's when you get the whole meeting and the synch times ch have changed or you can't correspond to a previous version with synch times that you get in trouble so was there anything else on your list

|yeah
Yeah .
|so i 'm not sure who isn't involved with that |i mean certainly me chuck and jane |anyone else care |a little better error uh noise cancellation
So I 'm not sure who isn't involved with that .| I mean , certainly me , Chuck and Jane .| Anyone else care ?| a little better error uh , noise cancellation ,
|but we have in a point that everything is more or less the similar more or less similar
but we have in a point that everything is more or less the similar more or less similar .
|yeah then we just map it to a reject model in |and in fact that 's what we do now |cuz there 's cases even after jane listens where you know we have
Yeah , then we just map it to a reject model .| In and in fact , that 's what we do now .| Cuz there 's cases , even after Jane listens , where , you know , we have 
|yeah yeah yeah
Yeah , yeah , yeah .
|then so question mark colon is fine for that

|from |and so if you 're splitting things up into utterances |so for instance in a dialogue system where you 're gonna be asking uh you know th for some information there 's some initial th something |and you know the first time out you you might have some general average |but you you d you don't have very much information yet |but at after they 've given one utterance you 've got something you can compute your mean cepstra from that

|hhh the phonology component can handle actually assigning an intonation contour to that

|and you get that for each class you get a zero or a one
And you get that for each class , you get a zero or a one .
|yeah

|well cuz they 're s distinguishing between twenty three that 's your indicator there and twenty three that somebody happens to say in a meeting
Well , cuz they 're s distinguishing between twenty - three | that 's your indicator there , and twenty - three that somebody happens to say in a meeting .

|uh i was just gonna say isn't there aren't aren't there lots of ideas for doing voice activity or speech nonspeech |rather um by looking at um you know uh i guess harmonics or looking across time
Uh , I was just gonna say isn't there aren't aren't there lots of ideas for doing voice activity , or speech - nonspeech rather , um by looking at um , you know , uh I guess harmonics| or looking across time 
|ok |so um typically what i w you know i in uh i what i 've done before is i have a uh tape recorder with a reverse button

|so those that are l are listed in the acronyms |i actually know

|well yes |so and that that says that we could have lots more parameters actually

|so i 'm i uh was thinking that we should contact them |so it 's that 's sort of a beside the point point |but
So I 'm , I uh , was thinking that we should contact them .| So it 's that 's sort of a beside - the - point point .| But .
|so these are more or less uh some open problems |and uh well just a quick comment about probably all of use are now aware of the availability of this eh standard the i triple e eight hundred and two point eleven |uh in fact it is it is powering you know uh the evolution of the of the of networking industry in the wireless area |and in the beginning the first adaptors uh oops were only one and two megabytes per second |but now we you you can buy for for the same price for even the same price uh the new eleven megabytes per second version i 've been use it for for a while and it w can tell you it works pretty well and uh the thing is that these devices have two different modes of operation one of them and probably the most popular is uh l what we call the infrastructure mode

|i should say i didn't distinguish between overlaps and and interruptions |so some of these were backchannels and things like that
I should say , I didn't distinguish between overlaps and and interruptions .| So some of these were backchannels and things like that .
|so as far as i 've gotten is i 've uh been able to go through from beginning to end the um full htk system for the italian data and got the same results that um that uh stephane had

|i 'm a little confused |i thought that that one of the reason we thought we were so much faster than than uh the the other transcription uh thing was that that we were using the mixed file
I 'm a little confused .| I thought that that one of the reason we thought we were so much faster than than , uh , the the other transcription , uh , thing was that that we were using the mixed file .
|right |so it 's taking samples |it 's doing adaptation |it 's adjusting weights |and then it 's getting the sum |so um |uh anyway that 's that 's kind of a reasonable thing that i 'd like to have somebody try somebody look |and and the digits would be a reasonable thing to do that with |i think that 'd be enough data plenty of data to do that with |and i for that sort of task you wouldn't care whether it was uh large vocabulary speech or anything |uh um
Right .

to different kind of planes .| So . Um . But , um .| So it 's all it 's all stuff that none none of us are doing right now ,
|but but i think that we didn't do anything that |but well anyway so uh i wouldn't be too concerned about it with respect to that |although we should clear it with eric and dan of course |but these results are based on data which haven't had the uh haven't had the chance to be reviewed by the subjects

|and deriving separate decisions on each bands and trying to combine them |uh the advantage being like it doesn't have the latency of the neural net if it if it can
and deriving separate decisions on each bands , and trying to combine them .| Uh ,| the advantage being like it doesn't have the latency of the neural net if it if it can

|so n neural network uh is in some sense equivalent to computing you know higher order moments of what you

it 's 
|like not really understanding a

|but um
but , um ,
|maybe i mean i i think you could make the same argument |it 'd be just as legitimate for hybrid systems as well |ok |this this would be a good section for our silence detection

|eech eech or something
" Eech - eech " , or something .
|yeah
Yeah .
|ok
OK .
|um yeah i think she 's got a nice voice
Um | Yeah , I think she 's got a nice voice .
|right |it 's i mean it 's background might be might be a better word than silence

|so it 's not a strictly one dimensional signal
So it 's not a strictly one - dimensional signal .
|sounds good |yeah
Sounds good , yeah .
|but i think it was maybe |well i could recognize when there was a fricative at the beginning of a number |for some reason it was like a little bit of energy or some whatever you call it |and then it grew really big |i wonder if that was someone who was who had an accent |maybe |so like four and five and three all had this same characteristic |and six and seven o both had the same characteristics to their in the beginnings

|fuel it to the over the internet |and b between these both boxes i can assume |uh because the mobility happens there as a normal natural thing |and the forwarding process and the routing process should be no more separated from my point of view |and to have there a certain kind of intelligent mechanism that the packets can be used to set up the routes |because they have all the information they know where they have to go |because ip addresses are still there and within the packet

|and you know we 're saying well we won't to be able to separate them |so please pause between |but it 's very people don't like doing that |and so there is this prosodic thing which is which is indicating when whe the pauses between these digit strings |and then when they finish the actual the whole sheet there 's this nice wonderful yeah phrase @ @

|uh fff |well when we do spectral subtraction actually i think that this is the the two last figures
uh fff| Well . When we do spectral subtraction , actually , I think that this is the the two last figures .
|yeah |yeah |but ther more obvious is that |yeah the the more obvious is that that well using the th the fft um you just it gives you just information about if it 's voiced or not voiced |ma mainly i mean
Yeah .| Yeah , but ther more obvious is that | Yeah .| The the more obvious is that that | well , using the th the FFT , um , you just it gives you just information about if it 's voiced or not voiced , ma mainly , I mean .
|i i guessed that they were gonna do it some time during the semester

|you know i think if you 're talking if you 're thinking in terms of places as opposed to names different peop names people have given to different ways of talking |i would think north midwest and south midwest would be more common than saying midland |right |i mean i i went to s
You know , I think if you 're talking if you 're thinking in terms of places , as opposed to names different peop names people have given to different ways of talking , I would think North Midwest , and South Midwest would be more common than saying Midland ,| right ,| I mean , I I went to s
|yeah i think the reading zipcode stuff you 're thinking of would be ogi

|how should that be done |i mean it it seems like there 's a simple way
How should that be done ?| I mean , it it seems like there 's a simple way 
|ok

|so i mean does this capture like where do you put exchange money |is an errand |right |but what about uh
So I mean , does this capture , like , where do you put | " Exchange money " is an errand ,| right ?| But what about uh 
|no no praat |yeah yeah
No . No , Praat | Yeah . Yeah .
|right |i mean that that would be really helpful |that was sort of another possibility
Right .| I mean , that that would be really helpful .| That was sort of another possibility .
|so

|yeah
Yeah .
|you know what would be a u |i don't know if this would mess other things up |but it seems like kind of a pain to have all these split up files around |what would be easier would be like pointers
You know what would be a | u I don't know if this would mess other things up ,| but It seems like kind of a pain to have all these split up files around .| What would be easier would be like pointers .
|right
Right .
|ok
OK .
|data new new set up
data .| New new set up .
|oh yes |oh but good question |and you don't have to add any of those tags
Oh . Yes .| Oh , but | Good question .| And you don't have to add any of those tags .
|that that was ok
That that was OK .
|yeah
Yeah .
|so do you create this continuous stream from the individual utterance files
So , do you create this continuous stream from the individual utterance files ?
|and sometimes even laughs
And sometimes even laughs .
|and additionally we we already have a lot of data that 's been collected with that
And additionally we we already have a lot of data that 's been collected with that ,
|right
Right .
|yeah
Yeah .
|adding the outputs just like in the second propose the the proposal from for the first evaluation |mm hmm

|uh i g i guess i guess when people are working with single microphones they are more trying to do
Uh ,| I g I guess I guess when people are working with single microphones , they are more trying to do 
|mm hmm |ah
Mm - hmm .| Ah .
|and um then the other thing would be it might be nice to have a preliminary discussion of some of the other uh research uh areas that uh we 're thinking about doing |um i think especially since you you haven't been in in these meetings for a little bit maybe you have some discussion of some of the p the plausible things to look at now that we 're starting to get data |uh and one of the things i know that also came up uh is some discussions that that uh that uh jane had with lokendra uh about some some some um uh work about i i i d i i don't want to try to say cuz i i 'll say it wrong but anyway some some potential collaboration there about about the about the working with these data
and um then the other thing would be it might be nice to have a preliminary discussion of some of the other uh research uh areas that uh we 're thinking about doing .| Um , I think especially since you you haven't been in in these meetings for a little bit ,| maybe you have some discussion of some of the p the plausible things to look at now that we 're starting to get data ,| uh and one of the things I know that also came up uh is some discussions that that uh that uh Jane had with Lokendra| uh about some some some um uh work about| I I I d I I don't want to try to say cuz I I 'll say it wrong ,| but anyway some some potential collaboration there about about the about the working with these data .
|uh if they 're if they 're close it 's just a question of the sensitivity
Uh , if they 're if they 're close , it 's just a question of the sensitivity .
|mm hmm
Mm - hmm .
|yeah |so this 'll take some thought |cuz we have we um if we are in fact gonna have forty or fifty hours at some point and we we wanna ha have part of our work be on feature extraction it means that we need to have waveforms available somehow |i think listening to this is gonna be like watching somebody 's home movies
Yeah so this 'll take some thought cuz we have we um| If we are in fact gonna have forty or fifty hours at some point and we we wanna ha have part of our work be on feature extraction , it means that we need to have waveforms available somehow .| I think listening to this is gonna be like watching somebody 's home movies .
|oh really they 're doing an unknown number
Oh , really ?| They 're doing an unknown number ?
|or
or ?
|right
right ?
|um so you are already in that recognizer doing something that is likely to affect uh the the far field microphone uh formant
Um . So you are , already , in that recognizer , doing something that is likely to affect , uh , the the far - field microphone , uh , formant .
|yeah
Yeah .
|then there 's
Then there 's 
|yeah |but eh but my point is that it should not be under the networking group thing
Yeah , but eh but my point is that it should not be under the networking group thing .
|um
Um ,
|do when when is this planned for roughly
Do when when is this planned for roughly ?
|but as nancy just su suggested it 's probably ellipticus
But as Nancy just su suggested it 's probably ellipticus .
|but i really do think from everything that i 've run across that um you you should get gain in terms of the uh uh what you were saying
but I really do think from everything that I 've run across that um you you should get gain in terms of the uh uh what you were saying ,
|no one really says argh you know
No one really says " argh , " you know ,
|ok |so
OK .| So 
|um |yeah |so the idea was to train all the databases and obtain an alignment to train on these databases
Um | Yeah , so the idea was to train all the databases and obtain an alignment to train on these databases ,
|oh
Oh .
|and and so where do you get your thresholds from from something that you looked at |so you always have this problem |you 're going to new data |um h how are you going to adapt whatever |you can very quickly learn about the new data uh if it 's gonna be different from old data that you have |and i think that 's a problem with this
and and so where do you get your thresholds from ?| From something that you looked at .| So you always have this problem , you 're going to new data| um H how are you going to adapt whatever you can very quickly learn about the new data ? Uh , if it 's gonna be different from old data that you have ?| And I think that 's a problem with this .
|oh
Oh .
|and
and
|yeah
Yeah .
|so if it 's only inserting mm hmm "s here and there then wouldn't that be something that would be just as efficient to do at this end |instead of having it go through i b m then be patched together then be double checked here
So if it 's only inserting " mm - hmm "s here and there , then , wouldn't that be something that would be just as efficient to do at this end , instead of having it go through I B M , then be patched together , then be double checked here .
|i wonder if you could do an adaptor |i don't know if you can or not
I wonder if you could do an adaptor .| I don't know if you can or not .
|hey adam |you know what
Hey , Adam , you know what ?
|uh it |yeah |but all those things without question marks are also binary |right

|eh i mean the class you will overlapping speech overlapping is a class eh speech @ @ the class that 's
Eh , I mean , the class you will overlapping speech " overlapping " is a class , eh , " speech " @ @ the class that 's
|well partly it depends on how um how e effective it will be to apply an algorithm |because i this takes time

|i think because they have th log energy |yeah |and then just generate random number |they have some kind of mean and variance |and they add this number to to the log energy |simply |um
I think because they have th log energy ,| yeah ,| and then just generate random number .| They have some kind of mean and variance ,| and they add this number to to the log energy simply .| Um 
|that 's a good point |i see |good point good point
That 's a good point .| I see .| Good point good point .
|so up to you
So , up to you .
|so it 's
so it 's 
|huh
Huh .
|i don't think that |hmm |we have never seen big differences |once i thought oh i can now i have these much better models |i 'll re generate my initial alignments then i 'll get much better models at the end |made no difference whatsoever |it 's i think it 's eh i
I don't think that | Hmm .| We have never seen big differences .| Once I thought " oh , I can Now I have these much better models .| I 'll re - generate my initial alignments .| Then I 'll get much better models at the end . "| Made no difference whatsoever .| It 's I think it 's eh , i
|um
Um 
|i i |ok
I I | OK .
|and that becomes like four point three

|uh by just constraining yourself to have your filter be only a subtraction of the mean you 're kind of you know tying your hands behind your back
uh ,| by just constraining yourself to have your filter be only a subtraction of the mean , you 're kind of , you know , tying your hands behind your back
|a week |well maybe

|so that 's why it was good to have andreas say these things |but so we should probably talk about the ibm transcription process stuff that
So ,| that 's why it was good to have Andreas , say these things| but | So , we should probably talk about the IBM transcription process stuff that

|ah
Ah .

|well you have a like techno speak accent i think
Well , you have a like techno - speak accent I think .
|so why do we have sixteen channels instead of like some fewer number
So why do we have sixteen channels instead of like some fewer number ?
|ok |ok
OK . OK .
|right
right ?
|cuz he 's probably the one here |i mean he and dan are the ones who are at this point most experienced with the tandem |yeah |we 'd have to get s get some experience
cuz he 's probably the one here | I mean , he and Dan are the ones who are at this point most experienced with the tandem| Yeah . We 'd have to get s get some experience .
|oh no
Oh no .
|and yeah something like that could be possible |maybe even a umts to wavelan gateway |or i 'm not sure if that 's possible |like we u if umts re contains redirects or whatever like switches |i 'm not sure about it |it could be
and | Yeah , something like that could be possible ,| maybe even a UMTS - to - WaveLAN - gateway ,| or I 'm not sure if that 's possible like we U - if UMTS re contains redirects or whatever , like switches .| I 'm not sure about it .| It could be .

|see we have a different interpretation of this |he says it doesn't work |i said i think it works magnificently |but just not for the task we intended |uh it gets rid of the speech
See , we have a different interpretation of this .| He says it doesn't work .| I said , I think it works magnificently ,| but just not for the task we intended .| Uh , it gets rid of the speech .
|so
so .
|yeah
Yeah .
|is better
Is better .
|that would b |but that i think that that uh point has been realized |and it 's it 's not really um been defined yet |but there 's gonna be some kind of feedback and input from uh the action planner into all the analysis modules telling them what to expect and what the current state of the discourse is
That would| b but that I think that that uh point has been realized| and it 's it 's not really um been defined yet| but there 's gonna be some kind of feedback and input from uh the action planner into all the analysis modules , telling them what to expect and what the current state of the discourse is .
|yeah i 'm just thinking for people that that 's not sufficient for what the only sufficient thing would be for me to walk up to them and hand it to them
Yeah , I 'm just thinking for people that that 's not sufficient for , what the only sufficient thing would be for me to walk up to them and hand it to them .
|so not the speech nonspeech

|and that seems to be a lot of overlap
and that seems to be a lot of overlap .
|so i found that really hard
so . I found that really hard .
|yeah
Yeah .
|yeah
yeah .
|but if you want also to stick to the number of features that limit it to sixty then we go a little bit down
but if you want also to stick to the number of features that limit it to sixty , then we go a little bit down

|seven hundred eighty five instances
Seven hundred eighty - five instances .
|right |so well maybe the noise subtraction is subtracting off speech
Right .| So | Well , maybe the noise subtraction is subtracting off speech .
|yeah |yeah |well that that that 's another reason why very simple features things like energy and things things like harmonicity and residual energy are uh yeah are are better to use than very complex ones |because they 'll be more reliable
Yeah .| Yeah .| Well , that that that 's another reason why very simple features , things like energy , and things things like harmonicity , and residual energy are uh , yeah are are better to use than very complex ones because they 'll be more reliable .
|i have one more point to to bhaskara 's question |um i think also the the the deep understanding part of it is is going to be in there to the extent that we um want it in terms of our modeling |we can start you know basic from human beings model that its motions going walking |seeing we can mem model all of that and then compose whatever inferences o we make out of these really conceptual primitives that will be extremely deep in the in in in my understanding
I have one more point to to Bhaskara 's question .| Um , I think also the the the deep understanding part of it is is going to be in there to the extent that we um , want it in terms of our modeling .| We can start , you know , basic from human beings ,| model that ,| its motions ,| going , walking , seeing ,| we can mem model all of that| and then compose whatever inferences o we make out of these really conceptual primitives .| That will be extremely deep in the in in in my understanding .
|and so so now they want to say we we will require fifty percent improvement only for well matched condition and only twenty five percent for the serial cases
And so , so now they want to say " we we will require fifty percent improvement only for well matched condition , and only twenty - five percent for the serial cases . "

|and the the another question that when i review the the the work of javier i think the nnn the nnn that the idea of using a neural network to to get a broad class of phonetic eh from eh uh a candidate from the the the speech signal if you have eh uh i 'm considering only because javier eh only consider eh like candidate the nnn eh the silence |because it is the the only model eh eh he used that eh eh nnn to detect the the possibility of a a change between the between the speaker

|uh does it go to seventy or eighty or does it use up so much memory we can't decode it
uh , does it go to seventy or eighty ?| Or , does it use up so much memory we can't decode it ?
|right |so so did dave did dave do that change where you can actually just click rather than having to go up to the menu to listen to the individual channels
Right ,| so so| did Dave Did Dave do that change where you can actually just click rather than having to go up to the menu to listen to the individual channels ?
|yeah |and now we have another percent with the v t

|so is the idea you 're going to do this paper
So , is the idea you 're going to do this paper
|it 's ambiguous |so it 's ok
It 's ambiguous , so it 's OK .
|for the mismatched they are around like let 's say one point five percent |and for the well m uh hm they are also around one point five

|yeah yeah yeah

|um |yeah |so this would be the first thing |and then of course try to well kind of debug what was wrong eh when we do aurora test on the msg particularly and on the multi band

|actually let me just s since since you brought it up i was just it was hard not to be self conscious about that when it after we since we just discussed it |but but uh but i realized that that um when i 'm talking on the phone certainly and and saying these numbers i almost always say zero we 're going uh you know |and uh |cuz because uh i it 's two syllables it 's it 's more likely they 'll understand what i said |so that that that 's the habit i 'm in |but some people say o and

|well the recursion f recursion for the mean estimation is a filter with some kind of delay |yeah i guess we can try to have some kind of new baseline for next week perhaps with all these minor things modified |and then do other things play with the spectral subtraction and retry the msg and things like that

|ok i 'll do that

|ok
OK .
|um it was like rasta in the sense that of it was um de convolution by filtering

|yeah that
Yeah , that 
|well you can do you can you can you can do certain normalizations like you know gain control
Well , you can do You can you can you can do certain normalizations like , you know , gain control ,
|so remind me afterward

|mm hmm
Mm - hmm .
|did you take pictures of the boards
Did you take pictures of the boards ?
|but no one will listen to the hours and hours of

|it 's all speech |yeah yeah
It 's all speech .| Yeah . Yeah .
|that 's all i have you wanna talk about recognition
That 's all I have .| You wanna talk about recognition ?
|and um some of the errors occurring very frequently are just things like the first word being moved to as early as possible in the recognition |which is a um i think was both a a pruning problem and possibly a problem with needing constraints on word locations
and um ,| some of the errors occurring very frequently are just things like the first word being moved to as early as possible in the recognition ,| which is a um , I think was both a a pruning problem| and possibly a problem with needing constraints on word locations .

And people talking about pictures and pictorial representations
|yeah i 'm just gonna sit here
Yeah , I 'm just gonna sit here
|so you didn't get one |oh interesting
So you didn't get one ?| Oh , interesting .
|you don't find that usage |uh uh i checked for it in the brown national corpus
You don't find that usage ,| uh uh , I checked for it in the Brown national corpus .
|mm hmm
Mm - hmm .
|right
Right .
|um |well yeah i guess
Um . Well , yeah ,| I guess .
|i i don't recognize a lot of these

|to tell you the truth i 'd rath i 'd i 'd would like to avoid more than one icsi meeting per day if possible

|so i
so I
|oh one |yeah

|well the the offices are actually a little the think of um ramps coming out of the double helix |and then you have these half domes glass half domes |and the offices are in in the glass half dome
Well , the the offices are actually a little | the ,| think of um , ramps , coming out of the double helix| and then you have these half - domes , glass half - domes ,| and the offices are in in the glass half - dome .

|apical alveolar kind of thing

|can you hear that

|both to get the um to figure out what type of meeting it is and to do any kind of higher level work on it |like well i was talking to morgan about

|so if there 's sort of machines sitting around and people sitting around and they 're waiting for other things to finish then sure |but uh chuck had been asking about that earlier as kind of a control to know |um cuz i mean you could imagine a fantasy in which you said that dave 's processing made the uh far microphone like the near microphone

|um so since last week we 've started to fill the column with um uh features w with nets trained on plp with on line normalization
Um . So since last week we 've started to fill the column with um uh features w with nets trained on PLP with on - line normalization

|that 's great

|instead of age put date of uh year of birth

|so i mean the standard sort of way of doing that is take a look at the algorithms you 're looking at |but then throw in some discriminative aspect to it |y y this is more like you know how does lda differ from pca |i mean they 're the same sort of thing
So , I mean , the standard sort of way of doing that is take a look at the algorithms you 're looking at , but then throw in some discriminative aspect to it .| Y y this is more like , you know , how does LDA differ from PCA ?| I mean , they 're the same sort of thing .

|it 's it 's spatial reference frames you actually have only |um if you wanna have a this is usually um i should there should be an l |though |well actually you have only have two choices |you can either do a two point or a three point |which is you you 're familiar with th with the origo |where that 's the center |origo is the center of the f frame of reference |and then you have the reference object and the object to be localized

|yeah just to see if by doing nothing in the modeling of just having that training data wh what happens
Yeah , just to see if by doing nothing in the modeling of just having that training data wh what happens .
|if we look at the france telecom proposal they use some kind of noise addition |they have a random number generator |right |and they add noise on the trajectory of uh the log energy only |right

|mm hmm

|yeah |yeah there was that we that 's right |we had that one conversation about uh what what what did it mean for uh one of those speakers to be pathological
Yeah .| Yeah there was that we| that 's right ,| we had that one conversation about , uh , what what what did it mean for , uh , one of those speakers to be pathological ,
|so i mean clearly i if everybody 's collecting data to train on m maybe we should do something |i mean depending where i put it it press different things

|um and that 's now i 'm not going to bring that |so that 's basically what i have so far |and the rest is for airplanes |so x schemas then i would like to do |oh yeah |um liz suggested we could start off by uh doing the digits all at the same time |talk about the construction aspect |and then at the end about our bayes net

|and then it goes off to the ontology |once you have its type |so we build a little data structure |and so what we would do in that case is in our instance gadget have our e v |and if we d there isn't one we 'd get the type |and then have the e v as for the type |so we 'd have our own little uh eva tree

|yeah |ho how much memory d h how many |yeah |so that 's good |so why don't we just uh um i think starting starting a w couple weeks from now especially if you 're not gonna be around for a while we 'll we 'll be shifting more over to some other other territory

|eighty nine

|right
Right .
|well
Well .
|ah ok
Ah , OK .
|yeah |no it 's not |it 's it was trained on some alignment obtained |um uh for the italian data i think we trained the neural network on with embedded training |so re estimation of the alignment using the neural network |i guess that 's right
Yeah .| No .| It 's not .| It 's it was trained on some alignment obtained| um ,| uh For the Italian data , I think we trained the neural network on with embedded training .| So re - estimation of the alignment using the neural network , I guess .| That 's right ?
|sure

|yes
Yes .
|no if you used all the channels something like that
no , if you used all the channels .| Something like that ?

So I I wasn't there .| They they they they h must have had some discussion about video and the visual aspect , and all that .
|now there 's the issue of |oh ok |so there 's the issue of speaker normalization |so with the distant microphone you wouldn't know which speaker is talking |right
Now there 's the issue of | Oh , OK . So there 's the issue of speaker normalization .| So , with the distant microphone you wouldn't know which speaker is talking .| Right ?
|and um
And um .
|ok
OK .
|and that was enough to to train the system
and that was enough to to train the system .
|that would be cool

|um it sounded like he um he he it it wasn't really fleshed out |and maybe he did something that was interesting for the test situation

|uh i think so if you 're talking about the macrophone results that andreas had about um a week and a half ago i think it 's the same system

|uh but the other thing is he 's putting in w i was using the word reverberation in two ways |he 's also putting in uh a he 's taking out some reverberation |but he 's putting in something |because he has averages over multiple windows stretching out to twelve seconds |but i think they 're since they 're here they can talk about it themselves |which are then being subtracted from the speech |and since you know what you subtract sometimes you 'll be you 'll be subtracting from some larger number |and sometimes you won't

|ah ok
Ah , OK .

No .
|which is in file format |if we um get really w wild on this we may actually want to use some some corpora that other people made |and for example if if they are in in mate then we get x m l documents with discourse annotations |t

|that 's right
That 's right .
|yeah with my
Yeah . With my 
|good point a point |well i 'm sorry if i sound a little peeved about this whole thing |it 's just we 've had meeting after meeting after meeting a on this |and it seems like we 've never gotten it resolved
Good point .| A point .| Well , I 'm sorry if I sound a little peeved about this whole thing .| It 's just we 've had meeting after meeting after meeting a on this| and it seems like we 've never gotten it resolved .
|so i 'm still just really not clear on what i 'm looking at the scenario box |like what does that look like for an example

|oh you mean on the digit form
Oh you mean on the digit form ?
|or wh
Or wh
|but eh is
but eh is
|i see |ok
I see .| OK .
|yeah |so alright so let 's go let 's go back then to the the chart with all the decisions and stuff and see how we 're doing
Yeah .| So , alright , so let 's go let 's go back then , to the the chart with all the decisions and stuff , and see how we 're doing .
|thirty seven fifty or something like that |and i do not know what the um icsi um front end would do |i mean what the bandwidth is |um |but the results are such that uh let 's see
thirty - seven fifty or something like that .| And I do not know what the um ICSI um front - end would do .| I mean , what the bandwidth is .| Um ,| but the results are such that| uh , let 's see 
|and much harder to p to program

|well let me ask you if if both people were over there it would be less effective than if one was there and one was across catty corner
Well , let me ask you , if if both people were over there , it would be less effective than if one was there and one was across , catty - corner ?

|so if you know anyone interested in in what i 'm about to describe tell that person to to write a mail to me or jerry soon fast |um the idea now is to sort of come up with a high level of sort of abstract tasks |go shopping um take in uh a batch of art |and um they 're engaged in in various activities |some of which you will hear about today |um visit do some sightseeing blah blah blah blah blah |sort of analogous to what fey has started in in in compiling compiling here |and already she has already gone to the trouble of of anchoring it with specific um o um entities and real world places you will find in heidelberg and um so out of these f s these high level categories the subject can pick a couple such as if if there is a cop uh a category in emptying your roll of film the person can then decide ok i wanna do that at this place sort of make up their own itinerary a and and tasks and the person is not allowed to take sort of this h high level category list with them but uh the person is able to take notes on a map that we will give him and the map will be a tourist 's sort of schematic representation with with symbols for the objects and so the person can maybe make a mental note that ah yeah i wanted to go shopping here

|not not not much
not not not much .
|so this is all this is there 's this linguistic facts |but apparently the uh here 's the way the findings go that you know they do mri |and and if you 're uh got something within reach then there 's one of your areas lights up |and if something 's out of reach uh a different one |um my suggestion is that robert and johno sort of give us a report on last week 's adventures |uh to start |but here 's the the amazing result |um they say you get someone with a with a deficit |so that they have a perfectly normal ability at distance things |so the s typical task is subdivision so there 's a a line on the wall over there and you give them a laser pointer and you say where 's the midpoint and they do fine if you give them the line and they have to touch it they can't there 's just that part of the brain isn't functioning so they can't do that here 's the real experiment the same thing on the wall you give them a laser where is it they do it
So this is all This is There 's this linguistic facts .| But apparently , the Uh . Here 's the way the findings go .| That , you know they do MRI , and and if you 're uh got something within reach then there 's one of your areas lights up ,| and if something 's out of reach uh a different one .| Um . My suggestion is that Robert and Johno sort of give us a report on last week 's adventures uh to start .| But here 's the the amazing result , um , they say .| You get someone with a with a deficit so that they have a perfectly normal ability at distance things .| So the s typical task is subdivision .| So there 's a a line on the wall over there , and you give them a laser pointer , and you say , " Where 's the midpoint ? "| And they do fine .| If you give them the line , and they have to touch it ,| they can't .| There 's just that part of the brain isn't functioning , so they can't do that .| Here 's the real experiment .| The same thing on the wall , you give them a laser , " where is it ?

|i don't think it can handle french |but anyway

|oh it looked ok |never mind |um |yeah |and so this this past week um i 've been uh looking a little bit into uh traps |um and doing doing traps on on these e events too |just um seeing seeing if that 's possible

|marking just a little bit and counting on the statistical methods |basically the more we can mark the better |but if there seems to be a lot of effort for a small amount of reward in some area and this might be one like this |although i i i 'd be interested to h get get input from liz and andreas on this to see if they cuz they 've they 've got lots of experience with the breaths in in uh uh their transcripts

|maybe um if we look at the if we split it up again into sort of um if we look at the uh the endpoint again we we said that for each of these things there are certain preconditions |so you can only enter a place if you are not too tired to do so |and also eh have the money to do |so if it costs something |so if you can afford it and perform it is preconditions |viewing usually is cheap or free |is that always true

|so but you know uh you can get |i don't know if you even want to run the big one uh um in the in the final system |cuz you know it takes a little while to run it |so um you can scale it down by |i 'm sorry |it was two three weeks for training up for the large broadcast news test set training set

|so um y you could imagine that |i mean just like we 're saying voiced unvoiced is good to know |uh male female is good to know also
So , um .| Y you could imagine that | I mean , just like we 're saying voiced - unvoiced is good to know | uh , male female is good to know also .
|the only reason i 'm asking is you 're gonna need space to split them up |and so i wanted to make sure we had some available for you

|well why do i wouldn't say forty hour weeks |no |but what i mean is oh i shouldn't say it that way |because that does sound like forty hour weeks |no |i th i i would say they 're probably they don't have o they don't have other things that are taking away their time

|hmm
Hmm .
|um
Um 
|yeah
Yeah .
|i see |i mean residual lpc energy and just plain energy are very closely related |even though they 're different |and um so um you really may need to go to something that looks at i in some sense harmonicity or um um relationship to or fit fit to pitch tracks on uh on either side of of it for instance
I see .| I mean , residual LPC energy and just plain energy are very closely related , even though they 're different| and um so um you really may need to go to something that looks at i in some sense harmonicity , or um um relationship to or fit fit to pitch tracks on uh on either side of of it , for instance ?

|so we somehow need to have a formalized um way of writing this down basically |and that 's where the shared interpretation of of certain terms and keywords comes in again |and using this and some some uh knowledge about the domain i think you can do some some simple inferences |like you know that when somebody 's working about uh working on on servlets for example he 's using java |cuz servlets are used are written in java |so some some inferences like that |now um u using this you can infer more information |and you could then match this to the meta data of um off the documents |you 're you 're searching against so uh what i wanna do is basically have some sort of um given these inputs and then i can compute how many documents match and use this as a metric in the search now what i plan to do is i want to uh sort of do a uh uh try to improve the quality of the search results and i want to do this by having a depth uh um um steepest descent approach so if i knew which operating system the person was working on would this improve my search result and and having uh uh a symbolic formalized model of this i could simply compute that

|so this is an that anything you have in the party line anything you have as the semantic side of constructions comes from pieces of this ignoring li
So this is an that anything you have , in the party line , anything you have as the semantic side of constructions comes , from pieces of this ignoring li
|of sorts |yeah |so so it seems like the main different there is the is the uh filtering |and the filtering |i think if you can shouldn't take a lot of memory to do that |uh and i also wouldn't think the cpu uh would be much either for that part |so if you can if you can add those in um then uh you can cut the data rate in half
Of sorts ,| yeah ?| So | so , it seems like the main different there is the is the , uh , filtering .| And the filtering I think if you can | shouldn't take a lot of memory to do that Uh , and I also wouldn't think the CPU , uh , would be much either for that part .| So , if you can if you can add those in um then , uh , you can cut the data rate in half .

|it 's about a fifty minute drive |right |so
It 's about a fifty minute drive ,| right ?| so
|and something |so but if we were dealing with two hundred hours or something i think it 'd be prohibitive |right |so so we have some stuff with no overlap uh for which there would be near near field results

Yeah . So , like , you were saying , like in the case of something with clipping ,
|they can change it to |one of them is censor |and the other one is incorrect
they can change it to . One of them is " censor " , and the other one is " incorrect " .
|so i in th the problem is that if we proceed like we just described um when he goes to m um create the new s training data with his processing he throws out some speakers |so the t two training sets won't be identical

|yeah
Yeah .
|i
I
|ok |um so i think the middle block doesn't really give you any more information ex than the top block |and the bottom block similarly only just illus |you know all it does is illustrate that you can drop the subscripts |and and that you can drop the um uh that you can give dual types
OK , um ,| so I think the middle block doesn't really give you any more information , ex than the top block .| And the bottom block similarly only just illus you know , all it does is illustrate that you can drop the subscripts and and that you can drop the , um uh , that you can give dual types .
|that 's great

|ah that was the second thing |it has some shock value
Ah . That was the second thing .| It has some shock value .
|that 's |oh
That 's | Oh !
|but wasn't it |uh i think dave was saying that he preferred that people didn't put stuff in slash scratch |it 's more putting in d s xa or xb or
But wasn't it , uh | I think Dave was saying that he preferred that people didn't put stuff in slash - scratch .| It 's more putting in d s XA or XB or ,
|i love that story
I love that story .
|which actually led to roughly the same number of gaussians overall |so that the system configuration is is comparable |um and the uh so without adaptation you had forty nine p

|yep |right |it was not a big deal

|um one of the ideas that we had come up with last week for things to try to improve the system |um actually i i s we didn't |i guess i wrote this in after the meeting |b but the thought i had was um looking at the language model that 's used in the htk recognizer |which is basically just a big loop

|mm hmm
Mm - hmm .
|and then
and then 
|all ten hours
All ten hours ?
|no
No .
|i mean i i i c i totally agree this was a a difficult person to to understand
I mean , I I I c I totally agree .| This was a a difficult person to to understand .
|so but but if we have a finite what
So , but but if we have a finite | What ?
|i it 's not cor it 's correct
I it 's not cor it 's correct ?
|now i
Now I
|you actually don't
You actually don't .
|uh
Uh ,
|as an argument
As an argument .
|but it looks of complect object trees and decides how are there parts missing that need to be filled out |there 's this is maybe something that this module can do something that this module can do |and then collect uh sub objects and then recombine them and put them together |so maybe this is actually some some useful tool that we can use to rewrite it and uh get this part

|ok
OK .
|or only the networking uh page

|uh huh
Uh - huh .
|um |yeah |so it 's |yeah i think it must be three and a half weeks
Um . Yeah . So it 's Yeah . I think it must be three and a half weeks .
|d yeah depending on their auditory um capabilities

|how big is the net

|not t not

|yeah i think it would be interesting |because then we could regularly get another meeting
Yeah , I think it would be interesting because then we could regularly get another meeting .
|yep
Yep .
|mm hmm
Mm - hmm .
|so i think after that we need another uh rack or something
So I think after that we need another , uh , rack or something .
|yeah i 'm sure i have |um i think it was november two thousand three or some |no wh i had something in my calendar
Yeah . I 'm sure .| I have um I think it was November two thousand three or some | No . Wh - I had something in my calendar .
|um well it was just amazing to to see uh how how instable the whole thing is
Um . Well it was just amazing to to see uh how how instable the whole thing is ,
|yeah d uh it 's much better when you we used the clean derived lda filter
Yeah ,| d uh , it 's much better when you we used the clean derived LDA filter .
|which is the
Which is the 
|yeah |cuz if if the log probs that are coming out of the msg are really big the standard insertion penalty is gonna have very little effect
Yeah .| Cuz if if the log probs that are coming out of the MSG are really big , the standard insertion penalty is gonna have very little effect
|and um and we were gonna use one of the p z |i don i don't know what probably whatever one you 've been using for for for the digits
and Um ,| and we were gonna use one of the P Z| I don I don't know what | Probably whatever one you 've been using for for for the digits .
|yeah |ok
Yeah , OK .
|i don't know |but it seemed it didn't seem to be a problem at all |i would imagine you add sixty four to a hundred and twenty eight
I don't know ,| but it seemed it didn't seem to be a problem at all .| I would imagine you add sixty - four to a hundred and twenty eight .
|any objection

|well this is this is just
Well , this is this is just 
|yeah in the very beginning
Yeah , in the very beginning .
|right
Right .
|that 's on the added variable |isn't it
That 's on the added variable ,| isn't it ?
|mm hmm
Mm - hmm .
|well uh first we discussed about some of the points that i was addressing in the mail i sent last week
Well . Uh first we discussed about some of the points that I was addressing in the mail I sent last week .
|right |what 's it trained on
Right ,| what 's it trained on ?
|but there is also this fascinating prosodic thing that goes on

|we have problem to with the with with the parameter with the representations of parameter

|well one th

|i mean that when when you use eh eh any

|we |yeah |but the bayes net that would merge |or what is the situation type |i just realized that i had my hand in between my mouth and my micr er my and my microphone |so then the bayes net that would merge there that would make the decision between go there info on and location would have a node to tell you which one of those three you wanted |and based upon that node then you would look at the other stuff
We Yeah , but , the Bayes - net that would merge | Or , what is the situation type ?| I just realized that I had my hand in between my mouth and my micr er , my and my microphone .| So then , the Bayes - net that would merge there , that would make the decision between Go - there , Info - on , and Location , would have a node to tell you which one of those three you wanted ,| and based upon that node , then you would look at the other stuff .
|right exactly
Right . Exactly .
|ok |ok
OK . OK .
|you 're talking about as a pre processing step |right |morgan
You 're talking about as a pre - processing step .| Right , Morgan ?
|we do the digits and then we get our treats
We do the digits and then we get our treats .
|yeah
Yeah .
|and then when you are in the silence it goes somewhere
and then when you are in the silence it goes somewhere ,
|and and sort of try to optimize the search in this way |now the big problem that i 'm facing right now is um it 's fairly easy to hack up a system uh quickly that that works in the small domain |but the problem is obviously the scalability |and uh uh so robert was mentioning uh earlier today is that uh microsoft for example with their printer set up program has a bayesian network which does exactly this |but there you face a problem that these are very hard to extend |and so uh what i 'm what i try to do is basically try to model this uh in a way that you could really combine uh knowledge from very different sources and and um sort of looking into some of the ideas that the semantic web community uh came up with

|ok good
OK .| Good .
|uh huh
Uh - huh .
|is cvs like yeah just keep the lock on |i mean just check it out |check it out
Is CVS , like | Yeah , just keep the lock on .| I mean , just check it out check it out
|yeah what is our
Yeah , what is our 
|is it can it be entered |then of course this is sort of binary as well
" Is it Can it be entered ? "| then of course , this is sort of binary as well .
|yes absolutely
Yes , absolutely .

|so

|yeah it does
Yeah , it does .
|uh
Uh .
|yeah
Yeah .
|because they do not use it |and to figure out whether they 're useful inse instead of using certain kind of tunneling mechanism |and to set up these tunnels and have the mapping between a psdn uh telephone number or whatever kind of number they are using to ip addresses |and then there 's the tunnel |i ds |yeah |ok |and and all this kind of things i think is very beneficial as well for for telecommunication providers

I mean , on uh , a l a lot tha tha a particular test set , that you that we reported at HLT .
|sure

|so you need the adaptive mechanism to minimize the coverage range

|mm hmm |but will we be able t to detect the voicing when there 's overlap
Mm - hmm .| But will we be able t to detect the voicing when there 's overlap ?
|you 're not talking about the entire page
you 're not talking about the entire page ?
|yeah
Yeah .
|and uh i guess it 's sort you know after after that meeting it sort of made more sense to me |because um if you 're dealing with power spectra then how are you gonna choose your error |and typically you 'll do choose something like a variance |and so that means it 'll be something like the square of the power spectra
And , uh , I guess it 's sort you know , after after that meeting it sort of made more sense to me| because um , if you 're dealing with power spectra then how are you gonna choose your error ?| And typically you 'll do choose something like a variance .| And so that means it 'll be something like the square of the power spectra .

|oh so maybe we can just substitute one of these wave forms |and um then do some kind of zoom in on the spectrogram on an interesting area

|unless we adopt a different set of norms |which is to not id to make a point of not identifying people by name |which then leads you to be more contextually ex explicit

|so change would we change post doc to post phd researcher
So , change Would we change " Post - doc " to " Post - PHD Researcher " ?
|yeah |yeah it 's basically ascii files or binary files |whatever representation
Yeah .| Yeah , it 's basically ASCII files or binary files , whatever representation .
|yeah |so twenty percent error rate on digits

|not important |so what is important is that we understand what the proposed task is |and the the i uh robert and i talked about this some on friday |and we think it 's well formed |so we think it 's a well formed uh starter task for this uh deeper understanding in the tourist domain

|so that sorting is easier

|and so i had to redo that one and just copy over the static data |and so i need to get with her now and delete the old stuff off the disk |and then i lo haven't done any of the aurora stuff |i have to meet with uh stephane to do that |so
And so , I had to redo that one and just copy over the static data .| And so I need to get with her now and delete the old stuff off the disk .| And then I lo haven't done any of the Aurora stuff .| I have to meet with , uh , Stephane to do that .| So .
|is it on

|yeah |no i think that 's that 's just fine |uh yeah |so they 'll they presumably there 'll be a thread or process or something that agent yeah agent whatever you wan wanna say |yeah that uh is rule driven and can can uh can do things like that |and um there 's an issue about whether there will be that 'll be the same agent and the one that then goes off and uh carries out the decision |so it probably will my guess is it 'll be the same basic agent that um can go off and get information |run it through a a c this belief net that
Yeah ,| no I think that 's that 's just fine .| Uh , yeah .| So they 'll they presumably there 'll be a thread or process or something that| " Agent " , yeah , " Agent " , whatever you wan wanna say , yeah ,| that uh is rule - driven , and can can uh can do things like that .| And um there 's an issue about whether there will be that 'll be the same agent and the one that then goes off and uh carries out the decision ,| so it probably will .| My guess is it 'll be the same basic agent that um can go off and get information , run it through a a c this belief - net that 
|huh
Huh .
|well see i was a little confused |because on this table i 'm the they 're showing word error rate |but on this one i i don't know if these are word error rates |because they 're really big |so under condition one here it 's ten percent |then under three it goes to sixty four point six percent
Well , see , I was a little confused| because on this table , I 'm the they 're showing word error rate .| But on this one ,| I I don't know if these are word error rates| because they 're really big .| So , under condition one here it 's ten percent .| Then under three it goes to sixty - four point six percent .
|but i think it 's gonna be more instructive to to think about uh other decisions that we need to make in path land and what they 're gonna look like
but I think it 's gonna be more instructive to to think about uh other decisions that we need to make in path land .| And what they 're gonna look like .
|so um that 's a difference that i don't think we put any way to get around
So um| That 's a difference that I don't think we put any way to get around ,
|yeah
Yeah .
|oh
Oh .
|and then then they get beep two beep three chuck wooters |does the numbers |and um it cycles through
And then then they get " beep two " , " beep three " .| Chuck Wooters does the numbers .| And , um , it cycles through .
|we we we we don't |uh
We we we we don't , uh 
|oh yes |and that too
Oh yes , and that too .
|but but uh we could you know if you want to get four disks get four disks |i mean it 's it 's small |i mean these things ar are just a few hundred dollars
but But uh , we could You know , if you want to get four disks , get four disks .| I mean it 's it 's small I mean these things ar are just a few hundred dollars .

|well they are they are using the the the same idea of labelling packets with a with a content descriptor or something

I th I think that 's g that 's good .
|does that make sense
Does that make sense ?
|and then we cut in half by
And then we cut in half , by 
|well i mean just to |yeah it is |so the issue is that um in belief nets it 's not common to do what we did of like having you know a d bunch of values and then unknown as an actual value
Well , I mean , just to | Yeah ,| it is .| So the issue is that um in belief - nets , it 's not common to do what we did of like having , you know , a d bunch of values and then " unknown " as an actual value .
|so that 's what you say th there |i see

|now the the you saw the note that the plp now is getting basically the same as the mfcc

|mm hmm
Mm - hmm .
|um ok |if we 're we 're done done with that |uh let 's see |so so you need to discuss with him what we 're doing |uh maybe we can talk about a couple other things briefly |just uh things that that we 've been chatting about but haven't made it into these meetings yet |so you 're coming up with your quals proposal |and uh wanna just give a two three minute summary of what you 're planning on doing
Um ,| OK ,| if we 're we 're done done with that ,| uh ,| let 's see .| So so you need to discuss with him what we 're doing ,| Uh , maybe we can talk about a couple other things briefly ,| just , uh , things that that we 've been chatting about| but haven't made it into these meetings yet .| So you 're coming up with your quals proposal ,| and , uh Wanna just give a two three minute summary of what you 're planning on doing ?
|yeah
Yeah .
|ok i 'd say we 're done
OK .| I 'd say we 're done .
|not compensated

|ah sorry |i guess that 's
Ah , sorry .| I guess that 's
|but you may not need a separate room you know
But you may not need a separate room , you know ,
|oh oh
Oh . Oh .
|yeah
Yeah .
|yeah they are
Yeah , they are .
|cool
Cool .
|right |i just thought if it was tried and true then and he 's gone through additional levels of of development
Right .| I just thought if it was tried and true , then and he 's gone through additional levels of of development .
|that 's pretty amazing
That 's pretty amazing .
|oh wow |so you 're just saying like what part of town the things are in or whatever
Oh wow .| So you 're just saying like what part of town the things are in or whatever ?
|yeah |yeah
Yeah . Yeah .
|yeah
Yeah .
|the best was fifty four point five

|right
Right .
|hmm
Hmm .
|yeah |ok |right

|well and actually um it is true that with respect to laugh there 's another one which is while laughing
Well , and actually , um , it is true that , with respect to " laugh " , there 's another one| which is " while laughing " ,
|right |so that when you 're developing it and it 's really rough you don't put it in the repository
right ?| So that , when you 're developing it and it 's really rough , you don't put it in the repository .
|and you know people 's jobs would get delayed |so it 's sort of a sharing thing
and , you know , people 's jobs would get delayed ,| so it 's sort of a sharing thing .
|they 're stored on popcorn

|you probably won't notice a difference |but it 's |i mean it 's definitely good that these are fixed |i mean obviously
You probably won't notice a difference .| But it 's I mean , it 's definitely good that these are fixed .| I mean , obviously .

|and here are the uh tasks to be implemented via our data collection

|all through friday would be fine
All through Friday would be fine .
|in other words if the transcripts aren't sort of good enough that the aligner constraints are good enough to sort of show you where the errors are then it wouldn't work |but it might work |it might work to do this if their transcripts are pretty close on the words that usually get recognized correctly |which are the you know function words the common words

|oh
Oh .
|yeah basically uh i did install it on my laptop |and |yeah
Yeah , basically uh I did install it on my laptop| and yeah
|yeah |yeah i would just sort of end it

|it is a unification base |it 's not it 's not as as theoretically bound as hpsg in particular
It is a unification base ,| it 's not it 's not as as theoretically bound as HPSG in particular ,
|ok
OK .
|you 're right |so if you were doing ten digit uh recognition you would really be in trouble
You 're right .| So if you were doing ten digit , uh , recognition , you would really be in trouble .
|curly brackets

|yeah
Yeah .
|alright
Alright .
|mmm
Mmm .
|and that and that dan worked on on that |so i thought that was really you know |so i mean you could ge pick up some of the micro items that wouldn't even occur as major headings
and that and that Dan worked on on that .| So I thought that was really | you know .| So , I mean , you could ge pick up some of the micro items that wouldn't even occur as major headings
|yeah

|right
right ?
|and they and they capitalize like every single first

|or in new york or in new york

|there 's some knocks
There 's some knocks .
|ok |ok |uh
OK .| OK .| Uh 
|during digits
during digits .
|so um my thought was maybe i mean they 're not used as probabilities |but the log probabilities |we 're taking advantage of the fact that something like log probabilities has more of a gaussian shape than gaus than probabilities |and so we can model them better |so in a way we 're taking advantage of the fact that they 're probabilities |because they 're this quantity that looks kind of gaussian when you take it 's log |so uh maybe maybe it would have a a reasonable effect to do that
So , um , my thought was maybe | I mean , they 're not used as probabilities ,| but the log probabilities | we 're taking advantage of the fact that something like log probabilities has more of a Gaussian shape than Gaus - than probabilities ,| and so we can model them better .| So , in a way we 're taking advantage of the fact that they 're probabilities ,| because they 're this quantity that looks kind of Gaussian when you take it 's log .| So , uh , maybe maybe it would have a a reasonable effect to do that .
|which both had roughly the same
which both had roughly the same ,
|anyway
Anyway .
|yes i think you can
Yes .| I think you can .
|um what else is there here |um |see the second second from the bottom |it says sil |but this is some different kind of silence or thing |or what was that
Um what else is there here ?| Um see the second second from the bottom it says SIL ,| but this is some different kind of silence or thing or | what was that ?
|yeah it was it was slightly worse
Yeah , it was it was slightly worse .
|but this is the next suggestion |liz liz and andreas can't sh can't uh can't come |so |ok |ok |so uh e l i guess let me uh get my my short thing out about the nsf
but this is the next suggestion ,| Liz Liz and Andreas can't sh can't uh , can't come .| so .| OK .| OK , so uh e l I guess , let me , uh , get my my short thing out about the NSF .
|everybody speaks hebrew

|yeah
Yeah .
|you know i list all the parent categories |it 's just like a frame hierarchy |right
you know i| list all the parent categories " .| It 's just like a frame hierarchy ,| right ?
|yeah
Yeah .
|and what they did finally is to mmm uh not to align the utterances but to perform recognition um only on the close talking microphone |and to take the result of the recognition to get the boundaries uh of speech
And what they did finally is to , mmm , uh , not to align the utterances but to perform recognition ,| um , only on the close - talking microphone ,| and to take the result of the recognition to get the boundaries uh , of speech .
|yeah
Yeah .
|maybe not a constant |but it doesn't uh don't like to divide by the variance of that
Maybe not a constant but it doesn't , uh don't like to divide by the variance of that ,
|so you really might wanna try the clean i think

Oh , I should 've | I was just thinking I should have invited him to this meeting .| I forgot to do it .| So .
|well that 's lovely
Well , that 's lovely .
|but uh this problem as you can see in the in the picture is uh really producing at least some reception problem at these two nodes |ok |so it is it is a problem that we have to address |and it is a new problem compared to wired uh media access control |and uh well some devel some protocols have been developed to avoid this problem and to try to address this particular behavior of wireless transmissions |and the main idea is to use some kind of a reservation mechanism |so we are um reserving a certain and a specific uh area of space so we can guarantee that nobody is trying to use the same space at the same time ok this is the basic idea

|i 'm i what i think is that why not have the corpus |since it 's so expensive to put together |uh useful for the widest range of of central corp things that people generally use corpora for and which are you know used in computational linguistics

|so uh and the directory for this i call it i asr zero point one |because it 's sort of meant for recognition

|no u maybe it 's this this idea of having different on line normalization um tunings for the different mfcc 's
No .| u Maybe it 's this this idea of having different on - line normalization , um , tunings for the different MFCC 's .
|so we would have to at least do that

|yeah that 's a good idea |i 'll ask her if she can con track some of them down
Yeah , that 's a good idea .| I 'll ask her if she can con track some of them down .
|cuz the one thing the one thing that seems to me we really should try if you hadn't tried it before |because it hadn't occurred to me |no you don't wanna change it for different conditions |no no i i i what what i 'm saying

|he has the histogram mechanism |he has the stuff that subtracts out |and all he has to do is change it uh uh from from log to plain energy |and plot the histogram |and look at it right now that he 's not really showing any kind of uh distinction |but uh and then he should go on and do the other stuff |bec

|we talked out about what we 're
we talked out about what we 're 
|and i think for this kind of discussion it matters |if it 's in the kiosk then the physical situation is the same |it 's gonna you know the exact interaction of the microphone 's gonna differ depending on the person and so forth |but at least the basic acoustics are gonna be the same |so f if it 's really in one kiosk then i think that you could just chain together and and you know as much as much speech as possible to |because what you 're really trying to get at is the is the reverberation characteristic

|uh but th the two th two thirty includes the tandem network

|yeah that 's another s thing |yeah |but um i mean there are also usually then holidays anyways |i mean like sometimes it works out that way
Yeah , that 's another s thing . Yeah .| But , um . I mean , there are also usually then holidays anyways .| I mean like Sometimes it works out that way .
|no |uh
No uh
|interesting |good |and systematize also maybe the encoding of it |if as we find some are useful and some are not so useful

|also there 's contec in concet contextual variation

|was that sort of the division

|um and then one of the one of those |since what i decided to do on morgan 's suggestion was just get two new microphones um and try them out

|mm hmm |mm hmm |mm hmm
Mm - hmm .| Mm - hmm .| Mm - hmm .
|but yeah |because there is perhaps one important thing that the net brings |and ogi show showed that is the distinction between sp speech and silence |because these nets are trained on well controlled condition |i mean the labels are obtained on clean speech |and we add noise after |so this is one thing |and but perhaps something intermediary using also some broad classes could could bring so much more information |uh

|we can just um go downstairs and and and look at this |but maybe not today |the other thing um i will |oh yeah |ok |i have to report um data collection
We can just um , go downstairs and and and look at this ,| but maybe not today .| The other thing um I will | oh yeah ,| OK , I have to report um , data collection .
|so you may need just a link from the main icsi page to the nsa page
So you may need just a link from the main ICSI page to the NSA page .
|yeah i thought i should um talk a little bit about that |because that might be a good uh sort of architecture to have in general for uh problems with you know multiple inputs to a node

|uh but since uh u u n u
uh but since uh u u n u 
|i mean there 's there 's all this stuff going on uh between uh andreas and and and dave and chuck and others with various kinds of runs uh um recognition runs trying to figure things out about the features |but it 's it 's all sort of in process |so there 's not much to say |agenda is according to this is transcription status darpa demos xml tools disks backups et cetera |and right now uh why don't we start with our our esteemed guest

|you know it 's like it 's that simple
You know , it 's like , it 's that simple .
|having access to it doesn't necessarily mean that having it

|so um |so what that says is that in a matched condition we end up with a fair amount worse putting in the uh plp
So , um So what that says is that in a matched condition , we end up with a fair amount worse putting in the uh PLP .
|wait why is that optional
Wait , why is that optional ?
|um
um
|and they basically said they have they have uh a tool they developed themselves |and they can't give away |uh f it 's too error prone |and had it 's not supported a a a and
And they basically said they have they have , uh , a tool they developed themselves| and they can't give away , uh , f it 's too error - prone ,| and had it 's not supported ,| a a a and 
|ok |yeah |ok |so this it 's the magnitude squared or something
OK .| Yeah ,| OK .| So this it 's the magnitude squared or something .
|what 's the technical term

|oh
Oh .
|mm hmm
Mm - hmm .
|ah ok |f um
Ah !| OK .| F um
|so um

|so so but this is being now discussed right now |and it 's possible that uh that that it may get through that we will still stick to fifty percent
So .| So . But this is being now discussed right now ,| and it 's possible that uh that that it may get through , that we will still stick to fifty percent .
|but but but but um let 's suppose just for a second that uh we 've sort of taken out a lot of the the major differences uh between the two
But but but but , um , let 's suppose just for a second that , uh , we 've sort of taken out a lot of the the major differences , uh , between the two .
|uh the the boundary
uh the the boundary 
|that you could call that you would tie into this representation with like an id |cuz we have a lot of breath noises
That you could call that you would tie into this representation with like an ID .| Cuz we have a lot of breath noises .
|i 'm using one of these
I 'm using one of these .
|ok
| OK .
|yeah

|ok
OK .
|usually i i don't know if that 's always the case |i i guess haven't looked at the data as much as you guys have |so um
Usually .| I I don't know if that 's always the case| I I guess haven't looked at the data as much as you guys have .| So . Um .
|so you have to take the whole the five |there should be five sheets
So you have to take the whole the five .| There should be five sheets .
|i 'm wondering if he were to just uh specify particular topics |i mean maybe we 'd be able to meet that request of his a little more
I 'm wondering if he were to just , uh , specify particular topics ,| I mean .| Maybe we 'd be able to meet that request of his a little more .
|yeah

|mm hmm |so i think the other thing i 'd like to do is do something about the set up
Mm - hmm .| So I think the other thing I 'd like to do is , do something about the set up
|yeah
Yeah .
|yeah
Yeah .
|and one should sort of reach out and try and get them all |mm hmm |yeah
and one should sort of reach out and try and get them all .| Mm - hmm , yeah .
|i mean a short time fft short time cepstrum calculation uh mean u mean calculation work that people have in commercial systems |they do this all the time

|so as part of this um project we need to transcribe these meetings |um to do training and test and so on |and uh so we need word transcripts and uh speaker change identification

|i think though the importance marking is a good idea though that if if people have something in front of them
I think , though , the importance marking is a good idea , though .| That if if people have something in front of them 
|mm hmm
Mm - hmm .
|and then i guess you 're supposed to treat
and then | I guess you 're supposed to treat 
|but what if you set if to the mean of the model then and it was a cons you set all c ones coming in through your test data |you you change whatever value that was there to the mean that your model had
But what if you set if to the mean of the model , then ?| And it was a cons you set all C - ones coming in through your test data , you you change whatever value that was there to the mean that your model had .
|oh
Oh .
|um so we will go through and in the speaker id tags there 'll be you know m one o seven m one o eight
Um , so we will go through and , in the speaker ID tags there 'll be , you know , M - one O seven , M - one O eight .
|can you just do like sux or something to modify |i mean if you just have one user that
Can you just do , like , SUX or something to modify | I mean , if you just have one user that 
|and so the the two options are change the transcript to match what they really said
And so the the two options are change the transcript to match what they really said ,
|well um i can give you an update on the transcription effort
Well , um , I can give you an update on the transcription effort .
|you do go to three languages including the english |it 's something like one point three
you do go to three languages including the English , it 's something like one point three .
|ok
OK .
|so
so .
|i mean this was something that we were talking about |we could get a very detailed overlap if they were willing to transcribe each meeting four or five times right one for each participant so they could by hand
I mean , this was something that we were talking about .| We could get a very detailed overlap if they were willing to transcribe each meeting four or five times .| Right ?| One for each participant .| So they could by hand

|uh huh
Uh - huh .
|yeah so that has nothing to do with economics or anything

|you know we had the mfcc 's before |lots of people have done voice activity detectors
you know , we had the MFCC 's before ,| lots of people have done voice activity detectors ,
|yeah |oh wow
Yeah .| Oh , wow .
|uh some other experiment things that people are doing are on there
uh , some other experiment things that people are doing are on there ,
|because i think it 'd be good if if we can get a few different sort of non internal types of meetings
because I think it 'd be good if if we can get a few different sort of non - internal types of meetings
|huh |ok |well that 's really useful |i mean this is exactly the kind of thing that i wanted to settle |um so
Huh .| OK .| Well , that 's really useful .| I mean , this is exactly the kind of thing that I wanted to settle .| Um ,| so 
|yeah
Yeah .
|uh if they submit the form i get it
Uh . If they submit the form , I get it .
|uh i probably just should have left it on

|so it 's sort of i i it 's sort of saying ok |so you much as you train your dictation machine for talking into your computer um you you have a car |and so you drive it around a bunch and and record noise conditions or something |and then i don't think that 's very realistic |i mean i th
So it 's sort of i i it 's sort of saying OK ,| so you much as you train your dictation machine for talking into your computer , um , you you have a car ,| and so you drive it around a bunch and and record noise conditions , or something ,| and then I don't think that 's very realistic ,| I mean I th

|we all by the way have the same digit form for the record
We all , by the way , have the same digit form , for the record .
|same thing |so there are very conventionalized like deictic ones |right |and then i think for other spaces that you introduce you could just attach y whatever you could build up an appropriately uh appropriate structure according to the l the sentence

|oh good
Oh , good .
|ok
OK .
|we have all the data transcribed |and we have these transcribers |and we were we 're the we 're still a bit slow on feeding |at that point |we 've caught up |and the the the uh the weak link is is recording meetings |ok |um two questions come is you know what how how do we |uh |it 's not really a problem at the moment |cuz we haven't reached that point |but how do we step out the recorded meetings |and the other one is um uh is there some good use that we can make of the transcribers to do other things

|mmm
Mmm .
|mm hmm
Mm - hmm .
|yeah |ok now what i would say |um
Yeah , OK . Now what I would say um ,
|so i think the goal the goal was what can we do |how can you do the data collection differently to get
So , I think the goal the goal was what can we do how can you do the data collection differently to get 
|yeah is really what i meant
yeah , is really what I meant ,
|like which i think is self reflexive in in the sort of brings focus back onto the jokemaker
like | which I think is self - reflexive in in the sort of brings focus back onto the jokemaker ,
|i mean no i i
I mean , no , I I

|whew |or we can move them
Whew .| Or we can move them .
|well so that 's a problem |yeah
Well . So that 's a problem .| Yeah .
|right as we all know |so
Right ?| As we all know .| So .
|cuz i noticed that a few times it would do it |it would move twice
Cuz I noticed that a few times it would do it it would move twice
|i don't know if i like that
I don't know if I like that .
|and leave other ones aside |even if it leaves incomplete tables someplace |uh uh it 's it 's really time to time to choose
and leave other ones aside even if it leaves incomplete tables someplace ,| uh uh , it 's it 's really time to time to choose .
|um so what i did is just to simply replace the vad based uh noise estimate by this estimate first on speechdat car |well only on speechdat car actually |and it 's uh slightly worse like one percent relative compared to the vad based estimates |um
Um .| So what I did is just to simply replace the VAD - based , uh , noise estimate by this estimate ,| first on SpeechDat - Car | Well , only on SpeechDat - Car actually .| And it 's , uh , slightly worse ,| like one percent relative compared to the VAD - based estimates .| Um ,
|and then grep basically
And then grep , basically .
|and the only thing that costs is the back up issue eh to first order
And the only thing that costs is the back - up issue , eh , to first order .
|ok
OK .
|whi which is not bad |because i mean that there 's multiple sens |i mean that particular case there 's mult there there 's a forced side of of that verb as well
Whi - which is not bad ,| because I mean , that there 's multiple sens| I mean that particular case , there 's mult there there 's a forced side of of that verb as well .

|it 's uh the one hundred number |it 's |well all these numbers are the ratio with respect to the baseline
It 's uh the one hundred number .| It 's , well , all these numbers are the ratio with respect to the baseline .
|and take a look to
and take a look to

|if it 's not the first minute of of the meeting that that 's ok with me |but in in the first minute uh often there are some some strange things going on which which aren't really well for which which aren't re re really good |so what what i 'd quite like perhaps is to have some five minutes of of of different meetings |so

|that 's right
That 's right .
|conceptually we know what should be done |when we see what people have done it may turn out that the easiest thing to do is to build a a separate thing that that just pools |i i like i i it it may be that the the instance w that we have to build our own instance uh things that with their types

|so um this is exactly what |because y you can never be sure |and i 'm sure even i the most sort of deliberate data collection experiment will never give you data that say well if it 's phrased like that the intention is this
So , um , this is exactly what | Because y you can never be sure .| And I 'm sure even i the most , sort of , deliberate data collection experiment will never give you data that say , " Well , if it 's phrased like that , the intention is this . "

|yeah |yeah |yeah |ok |but but anyway i would like to do that in the ad hoc network |this is maybe the sco this is within the scope of this uh special network that means here that is uh within the transmission power
Yeah ?| Yeah , yeah .| OK .| But - but anyway , I would like to do that in the ad - hoc network .| This is maybe the sco this is within the scope of this , uh special network .| That means here that is uh within the transmission power .

|mm hmm

|that 's for classification

|uh huh
Uh - huh
|not the the choices of where is x or how do i get to x |just where is x

|so one of one function that you could use as your g function is an e e evidence combining |so you just take the uh |if each of th if each of the ones has its own little table like that then you could take the uh strength of each of those times its little table |and you 'd add up the total evidence for v e and a

|so about a about an eight percent uh seven or eight percent relative
So about a about an eight percent , uh , seven or eight percent relative ?
|no but it seems like since we since we are getting towards uh subject uh fifty subjects and analogously for example here we have our eva um intention |and if we can keep it up um to a uh sort of five four ish per week rate we may even reach the one hundred before fey t takes off to chicago
No .| But it seems like since we since we are getting towards uh subject uh fifty subjects| And analogously for example , here we have our EVA um intention .| and if we can keep it up um to a uh sort of five four - ish per week rate , we may even reach the one hundred before Fey t takes off to Chicago .

|so that 's a good question |where does it come from |yeah i don't know |um but uh to tell you the truth i wasn't actually looking at the lda so much |when i i was looking at it |i was mostly thinking about the the vad |and um it ap it ap
So that 's a good question .| Where does it come from ?| Yeah , I don't know .| Um , but uh to tell you the truth , I wasn't actually looking at the LDA so much when I I was looking at it| I was mostly thinking about the the VAD .| And um , it ap it ap
|got a good core group now again |mm hmm
Got a good core group now .| Again .| Mm - hmm .
|mm hmm
Mm - hmm .
|but they use every all use a different one |yeah
but they use every all use a different one .| Yeah .
|and generated this this
And generated this this ,
|oh was it fifteen
Oh was it fifteen ?
|but i hate it when people do that to me |when they say here 's you id don't forget it
but I hate it when people do that to me ,| when they say , here 's you ID ,| don't forget it .
|the b the the double arrow
The b the the double arrow .
|well eh how |ok |so the one i 'm thinking of is like if like ha ha uh you say you would say like um uh like ok so he 's laughing ha ha |and then he 'd go i uh
Well ,| eh how OK , so the one I 'm thinking of is like if like " ha - ha "| uh , you say you would say like , um ,| uh like | OK ,| so he 's laughing| " ha - ha "| and then he 'd go " i uh " .
|ok |uh so it sounds like basically things are slowing down a bit |and and and trying to collate results and get something from it
OK .| Uh .| So it sounds like basically things are slowing down a bit ?| And and and trying to collate results ?| and get something from it ?
|so that
so that 
|hmm
" Hmm !
|i mean um i i i i think that somebody might request something even though we say that |but i think it 's good to at least start some place like that |so if we agreed ok how long is a reasonable amount of time for people to have
I mean ,| um ,| I I i I think that somebody might request something| even though we say that .| But I think it 's good to at least start some place like that .| So if we agreed , OK , how long is a reasonable amount of time for people to have 
|and found segments that would be useful |and at this point all four of the ones that he specified have been done |in addition the i 've i have the transcribers expanding the amount that they 're doing actually
and found segments that would be useful .| And at this point , all four of the ones that he specified have been done .| In addition the I 've I have the transcribers expanding the amount that they 're doing actually .
|and um let 's make those four |and maybe there are two |um |so maybe this could be sort of a separate region of the net which has two has it 's own middle layer |maybe this you know has some kind of um funky thing that di if this and this may influence these hidden nodes of the discourse |which is maybe something that is uh a more general version of the actual phenomenon that you can observe |so things that point towards

|well let 's see
Well , let 's see .
|yeah |so i i said well yeah ok |so he took another another three quarter of the year |but uh he was out |so i wouldn't surprise me if he has a plan like that though though |uh pratibha still needs to get out first
Yeah .| So I I said " well , yeah , OK " so he took another another three quarter of the year but uh he was out .| So I wouldn't surprise me if he has a plan like that , though though uh Pratibha still needs to get out first .
|s so i g so i guess the que the question i was trying to get at with those experiments is does it matter what models you use

|and and until they 've been listened to they stay as icsi
and and until they 've been listened to they stay as " ICSI " .
|i definitely think so

|um and so forth and so forth |that 's sort of motivating it |then what have we done |so far we had our little bit of um um smartkom stuff that we did
Um , and so forth and so forth .| That 's sort of motivating it .| Then what have we done so far ?| We had our little bit of , um , um , SmartKom stuff , that we did ,
|and so remind me the multilingual stuff is just the broad data

|would that doesn't that only change the scoring if a word has moved into a different segment |i mean i don't think that 's har |i hardly ever see that
Would that ? Doesn't that only change the scoring if a word has moved into a different segment ?| I mean , I don't think that 's har I hardly ever see that .
|well but that 's that was coincidence |right

|but in general it was really good |and i 'm hoping and this is this is good news |because that means the force alignments should be good |and if the force alignments |i mean it 's good news anyway |but if the force alignments are good we can get all kinds of information

|well it 's a sliding window |right |so if you take the the measure in the center of the overlapped piece you know there 'd better be some something or of things that
Well it 's a sliding window ,| right ?| So if you take the the measure in the center of the overlapped piece , you know , there 'd better be some something .| Or of things that 
|yeah

|well we should be getting new equipment in |so we don't have to use the earplug any more |because he 's familiar with the code
Well , we should be getting new equipment in , so we don't have to use the earplug any more .| because he 's familiar with the code ,
|and i don't know how that works |i there 's something down there about if you agree to

|and uh so the results are like |so far i 've been testing only with the baseline |which is which doesn't have any lda filtering and on line normalization |i just want to separate the the contributions out |so it 's just vad plus the wiener filter plus the baseline system |which is uh just the spectral |i mean the mel sp mel uh frequency coefficients |um |and the other thing that i tried was but i just took of those uh carlos filters which hynek had
And , uh . So .

|um i don't know whether i understand what you mean |but again in this given this input we also in some situations may wanna postulate an opinion whether that person wants to go there |now the nicest way use a cab or so s wants to know it wants to know where it is |because he wants something fixed there |because he wants to visit t it or whatever |so it n i mean a all i 'm saying is whatever our input is we 're always gonna get the full output |and some some things will always be sort of too not significant enough

|that uh i mean you know one could have if one had cheaper microphones than we have |leah leah noticed this one where i said something |and um the transcriber interpreted it as twosome gruesome uh different sizes different this but we 've got good microphones

|it 's ok but it 's
It 's OK .| But it 's 
|no but i think i think that it it it probably would be the case that if say we trained on italian uh data and then uh we tested on danish data |and it did terribly uh that that it would look bad |so to first order i mean you have other things you were gonna do |and i think someone would notice and would say well look this is not generalizing
No .| But , I think I think that it it | it probably would be the case that if , say , we trained on Italian , uh , data and then , uh , we tested on Danish data and it did terribly , uh , that that it would look bad .| So , to first order I mean , you have other things you were gonna do ,| And I think someone would notice| and would say " Well , look .

|uh not to mention that that uh mari 's putting together this report next week too |you know |so uh what we were hoping was that over the weekend we could do uh the um calculation on the training set |and uh uh maybe you know we could by the end of the weekend we could have the top one |and and then early next week do these |i see if we had enough machines maybe do them in parallel

|yeah |uh a few words |the university of mannheim is at location where joerg widmer is uh working on it |and i got the statement uh they are very interested in that they did a lot in the area of um intelligent classroom |but nevertheless they did a lot in networking stuff |and university of uppsala sweden |that 's the reason i invited uh christian tschudin the professor who did ten years work in in active routing |and uh ok the universidad nacional de educat |yeah spanish |maybe we have a better expert to pronounce it

|well even if you do it on something really long you need to know you can always chop it up |but you need to have a reference of which words went with which uh chop

|um |right |but you 'd have to figure out a way to to to uh incorporate it on the fly |uh i mean i guess as you say one thing you could do is simply uh have the the male and female output vectors |you know tr nets trained only on males and n trained only on females |and i guess you hadn't gotten to all the experiments you wanted to do with number of gaussians or or uh you know |but um i don't know if that would really help |because you already have males and females |and it 's mm hmm putting into one net so is it

|right |that makes sense |so i mean there 's this stuff in the off in the scenario which just tells you how various what schemas you 're using |and they 're how they 're bound together |and i guess that some of the discourse segment stuff

so uh and ,
|uh i mean first place there 's still this thing to to work out |and second place second thing is that the only results that we have so far from before were really development set results

|just sort of to de emphasize the jarring |so i think that would sort of be the first thing to do |but then yeah the lda i uh is interesting |because it would sort of say well suppose you actually trained this up to do the best you could by some criterion what would the filter look like then

|so we don't have start and end points at each point where there 's an overlap |we just have the the overlaps encoded in a simple bin |well ok |so @ @ the limits of the over of of the interface are such that we were at this meeting we were entertaining how we might either expand the the interface or find other tools which already do what would be useful

|and like |alright |well let 's start here |um so i haven't really gone into the you know looked at all of the stuff that 's going on |so i don't really |right |i mean once i start doing that i 'll have more to say about this kind of thing

|and they sort of always brush over this real quickly without really elaborating much of that |and uh as a matter of fact the only thing that m apparently really works out so far are library ordering codes |which are very very coarse |grain |so you have some like science biology |and then |but that 's really all that we have at the moment |so i think there 's a huge um uh need for improvement there |now what this uh a standard like this would give us is we could um sort of uh with a search engine just query uh different repositories all over the world |but we can't really um so what i 'm what i try to do is um to have um uh so so the scenario is the following you you 're working on some sort of project and you encounter a certain problem now what what we have at our university quite a bit is that uh students um try to u program a certain assignment for example they always run into the same problems uh and they always come running to us and they 'll say why 's it not it 's not working and we always give out the same answer so we thought well it 'd be nice to have a system that could sort of take care of this

|so the question is actually

|but this is a good discussion |we 're gonna have to somehow figure out uh some way to encapsulate that |uh so if there 's some general notion of for example the uh relation to the time to do this to the amount of time the guy has or something like that |is is the uh compatibility with his current state |so that 's what you 'd have to do |you 'd have to get it down to something which uh was itself relatively compact |so it could be compatibility with his current state |which would include his money and his time and and his energy

|uh uh i i don't know |i think we 're we 're integrated a little more tightly than happens in a lot of those cases |i think at the moment they they say that they have a better thing |we can we e e what takes all the time here is that th we 're trying so many things

|at least found in timit |um so i it would be a a measure of are we on the right track with with the the choices of our acoustic events
at least found in TIMIT .| Um so i it would be a a measure of " are we on the right track with with the the choices of our acoustic events " .
|ok
OK .
|which is ok |so implicitly everything in edu we 're always inferring the speaker intent |right |like what they want |either the information that they want |or it 's always information that they want |probably of some kind |right |or i i don't know
which is , OK so implicitly everything in EDU , we 're always inferring the speaker intent , right ?| Like , what they want| either , the information that they want , or | It 's always information that they want probably , of some kind .| Right ?| Or I I don't know ,

|instead of the the the the superclass thing which is to take |so suppose y you don't really mark arti to really mark articulatory features |you really wanna look at the acoustics and and see where everything is |and we 're not gonna do that |so uh the second class way of doing it is to look at the uh phones that are labeled and translate them into acoustic uh uh articulatory uh uh features |so it won't really be right |you won't really have these overlapping things and so forth

|uh in this case four |um which eh we used to do only three |and then we found out we can squeeze |and it was basically we 're s we 're keeping it on the safe side |but you 're d right |it might be that one more iteration would would help |but it 's sort of

|and um and so i 'm not gonna be checking them all i don't think in the @ @ for throughout the whole rest of the project |but um certainly have spot checking |but um hhh those that i have found that way to me i think f f the most sensible way to handle it from my perspective was to treat it as a pronunciation situation

|i can probably build it better |so it doesn't have such noise |but it 's kind of a buy

|yeah |but |yeah |but perhaps it 's not really the the alignment that 's bad |and |yeah |and here the gap is still more important between using delta and not using delta |but the just the ph phoneme string that 's used for the alignment

|so then we probably don't need the fine grained information

|in our case we have a couple things |we have the on line normalization |and then we have the lda rasta |and they seem to comple complement each other enough and be different enough that they both seem to help help us |uh but in any event they 're both doing the same sort of thing |but there 's one difference |the lda rasta uh throws away high modulation frequencies |and uh and and i guess actually uh after eurospeech for a little bit uh he 'll go up there too |and they 're not doing that

Right .| So this would be like if you take the words um you know and force align them on all the individual close talk uh close talking mikes then how good are these sort of in reality| Uh oh .
|mm hmm
Mm - hmm .

|and then maybe ask th uh these guys
And then maybe ask , th uh , these guys .
|yeah
Yeah .
|i don't know why he @ @

|like you have to wait for one more frame to pack |because it 's the crc is computed for two frames always
like you have to wait for one more frame to pack .| Because it 's the CRC is computed for two frames always .
|and then it would be harder
And then it would be harder 
|yeah we have the um the ones we 've been using the ones we got for the pc
Yeah .| We have the um the ones we 've been using , the ones we got for the PC .
|so we didn't talk at all about uh the other derivatives |but uh again just just looking at uh i think uh liz has a very good point that in fact it would be much more graphic just to show
So we didn't talk at all about uh the other derivatives ,| but uh again just just looking at | Uh , I think uh Liz has a very good point , that in fact it would be much more graphic just to show 
|actually you would say which films are on tonight

|and they can use it for their research |i mean this isn't really necessarily what you would do in a real system
and they can use it for their research .| I mean , this isn't really necessarily what you would do in a real system ,

|ok
OK .
|just as a suggestion maybe you could save as to keep your old one nice and clean |and so you can mess with this one

|you can hide it |yeah
You can hide it . Yeah .
|eh e and uh |mm hmm
eh e and uh| Mm - hmm .
|right |but what the the then the danger is in a group like this is that two people are working on the same thing |and i c of course both of them come with the s very good solution |but it could have been done somehow in half of the effort or something
right ?| but what the the then the danger is in a group like this , is that two people are working on the same thing and i c of course both of them come with the s very good solution , but it could have been done somehow in half of the effort or something .
|yeah maybe not |but it it i st still see it as i mean there 's there 's a history to this too
Yeah , maybe not .| But it it I st still see it as I mean , there 's there 's a history to this , too ,
|mm hmm
Mm - hmm .
|yeah but it 's not in the this is not on the web
Yeah , but it 's not in the | This is not on the web .
|ok |and um |ok |and go there has two values |right |go there and not go there |let 's assume those are the posterior probabilities of that
OK .| And , um ,| OK , and ,| Go - there has two values ,| right ? ,| Go - there and not - Go - there .| Let 's assume those are the posterior probabilities of that .
|uh we 're gonna have a short discourse

|they are a little bit better |yeah |but |mm hmm

|yeah |so one of the things that i need to i 've started looking at uh is this the appropriate time to talk about the disk space stuff
Yeah , so , one of the things that I need to I 've started looking at | Uh , is this the appropriate time to talk about the disk space stuff ?
|mostly they do
Mostly they do .
|hmm |mm hmm

|so y so you guys will send to the rest of us um a version of um this and the uh description
So y so you guys will send to the rest of us um a version of um , this ,| and the uh , description 
|right
right ?
|and i observe more more or less thing like this |and the paper said that eh these frequencies are probably eh harmonics
And| I observe| more | more or less ,| thing like this .| And| the paper said that , eh ,| these frequencies| are probably ,| eh , harmonics .
|um |uh yeah |so |yeah |and what they did at ogi is just uh they don't use on line normalization for the moment on spectral subtraction |and i think yeah i think as soon as they will try on line normalization there will be a problem
Um . Uh . Yeah .| So yeah .| And what they did at OGI is just uh they don't use on - line normalization , for the moment , on spectral subtraction| and I think | Yeah .| I think as soon as they will try on - line normalization there will be a problem .
|right |but we can do automated alignment |that 's not a problem

|right
Right .
|so you 're not using all of the data
So you 're not using all of the data .
|so uh
So , uh 
|i i i mean i guess what i what i i keep coming back to in my own mind is that um the soonest we can do it we need to get up some kind of system
I I I mean , I guess what I what I I keep coming back to in my own mind is that , um , the soonest we can do it , we need to get up some kind of system

|yeah |anyway i i i should really reserve uh any conclusions until we 've done it on the large training set |um and until we 've seen the results with the with the vtl in training |so
Yeah .| Anyway , I I I should really reserve , uh , any conclusions until we 've done it on the large training set , um , and until we 've seen the results with the with the VTL in training .| So .
|ok |so th |sorry i just don't kn um um um

|you guys didn't have o one channel per person before

|there 're comments of four types |so this is a good time to introduce that the four types |w and maybe we 'll expand that
There 're comments of four types .| So this is a good time to introduce that .| The four types .| w And maybe we 'll expand that
|yeah |so if it turned out to be a problem that you didn't have enough speech because you need a longer longer window to do this processing then uh one tactic is you know looking at the larger system and not just at the front end stuff is to take in um the speech with some simpler mechanism or shorter time mechanism
Yeah ,| so if it turned out to be a problem , that you didn't have enough speech because you need a longer longer window to do this processing , then , uh , one tactic is you know , looking at the larger system and not just at the front - end stuff is to take in , um , the speech with some simpler mechanism or shorter time mechanism ,
|yeah |yeah some of these things are captured by |yeah um by looking at at the minimum and maximum and whatever
Yeah .| Yeah . Some of these things are captured by Yeah . Um , by looking at at the minimum and maximum and whatever
|it was something like that |i don't think you can really tell a person |i don't think a person can tell the difference between uh you know a quarter of a second and a hundred milliseconds |and
it was something like that .| I don't think you can really tell .| A person I don't think a person can tell the difference between , uh , you know , a quarter of a second and a hundred milliseconds ,| and 
|channel b one two three four five
channel B , one two three four five .
|actually the acoustic may not be either |so it 's
Actually the acoustic may not be either .| So , it 's 
|uh
Uh 
|yeah i think everybody was focused elsewhere |um now one of the things that 's nice about what we did is we do have a a uh a filtering which leads to a a uh a reduction in the bandwidth in the modulation spectrum |which allows us to downsample
Yeah .| I think everybody was focused elsewhere .| Um , now , one of the things that 's nice about what we did is , we do have a a , uh a filtering , which leads to a a , uh a reduction in the bandwidth in the modulation spectrum , which allows us to downsample .
|that 's like the conch
That 's like the Conch .
|well i have to
Well I have to ,
|so by default it 'll be like true i guess |but because of the nature of this particular construction you know not just that it 's nominal of some kind |you know if you 're specifying events that did happen you could imagine that you skip out this |you know leave off this polarity |you know not don't have it here and then have it part of the speech act in some way
So by default it 'll be like " true " , I guess ,| But because of the nature of this particular construction you know not just that it 's nominal of some kind| you know , if you 're specifying events that did happen .| You could imagine that you skip out this you know , leave off this polarity ,| you know , not don't have it here .| And then have it part of the speech - act in some way .
|one would think one net

|what i 'm doing is trying to use the close talking mike and just use can and just generate candidate |and just try to get a first pass at something that sort of works
What I 'm doing is trying to use the close - talking mike and just use Can - and just generate candidate and just try to get a first pass at something that sort of works .

S so I think there are a variety of things in which um | Tour - tourists really do have different styles eating .| Another one ,| you know .
|and maybe try another type of spectral subtraction |i don't
and maybe try another type of spectral subtraction , I don't 
|so that i think he well by by saying this is a b a tentative block di diagram i think means if you construct it this way this this delay would work in that way |so i 'm just imagining |and then it 'd be ok

|yeah |so you could be we have quite a few spert boards |you could set up uh you know ten different jobs or something to run on spert different spert boards |and and have ten other jobs running on different computers |so it 's got to take that sort of thing |or or we 're not going to get through any significant number of these
Yeah .| So you could be | we have quite a few SPERT boards .| You could set up , uh , you know , ten different jobs , or something , to run on SPERT different SPERT boards| and and have ten other jobs running on different computers .| So , it 's got to take that sort of thing ,| or or we 're not going to get through any significant number of these .

|so so that should be possible |i mean that shouldn't be a problem |uh so that was the one thing |and the other was that um what was the other problem |oh that thilo wanted to use the recognizer alignments to train up his um speech detector

|mm hmm
Mm - hmm .
|but the way i 'm estimating the noise and the way i 'm estimating the snr i 'm just trying trying a little bit |so that h |and the other thing is like putting a floor on the uh snr |because that if some in some cases the clean speech is like when it 's estimated it goes to very low values |so the snr is like very low

|which is um so this issue of the uh legalistic aspects of the pre sent you know pre adapted |yeah |well so what i mean is um the uh the data that you take into sri first first question you 're maintaining it in in a place that wouldn't be publicly readable that that kind of stuff |right
Which is um so this issue of the uh legalistic aspects of the pre - sent you know pre - adapted | Yeah , well , so what I mean is| um| the uh the data that you take into SRI , first first question ,| you 're maintaining it in in a place that wouldn't be publicly readable that that kind of stuff ,| right ?
|i do that too

|yeah

|um which is a question how deep do we want to sear |you know |um |but we should try to keep in mind that you know we 're doing this sort of for research |so we we should find a limit that 's reasonable |and not go you know all the way back to adam and eve |you know did that person ever discuss admissions fee fees in his entire life |and the dialogues are pretty pretty you know concise |and anyway

|the the other thing i was suggesting though is that given that you 're talking about binary features uh maybe the first thing to do is just to count mm hmm and uh count co occurrences and get probabilities for a discrete |hmm |cuz that 'd be pretty simple |because it 's just say if you had ten ten events uh that you were counting uh each frame would only have a thousand possible values for these ten bits |and uh so you could make a table that would say if you had thirty nine phone categories that would be a thousand by thirty nine |and just count the co occurrences and divide them by the the uh uh uh occ uh count the co occurrences between the event and the phone and divide them by the number of occurrences of the phone mm hmm and that would give you the likelihood of the of the event given the phone and um then just use that in a very simple hmm and uh you could uh do phone recognition then and uh wouldn't have any of the issues of the uh training of the net or mm hmm i mean it 'd be on the simple side but

|if we end up getting this um what will it mean to icsi in terms of w wh where will the money go to |what would we be doing with it
If we end up getting this , um , what will it mean to ICSI in terms of , w wh where will the money go to ,| what would we be doing with it ?
|uh yeah |so this noise |um
Uh . Yeah .| So , this noise ,| um 
|mm hmm |yeah i don't think |i mean the fact that it blown u blows up is a huge issue in the sense that |i mean |ok |so say it blows up |right |so there 's like the you know ten f ten fifteen uh things |it 's gonna be like two to the that |which isn't so bad
Mm - hmm .| Yeah .| I don't think I mean , the fact that it blown u blows up is a huge issue in the sense that | I mean , OK .| So say it blows up , right ?| So there 's , like , the you know , ten , f ten , fifteen , uh , things .| It 's gonna be like , two to the that ,| which isn't so bad .
|for adaptation |no i 'm serious |so we have a problem with acoustic adaptation
for adaptation .| No , I 'm serious ,| so we have a problem with acoustic adaptation ,
|i in al an uh an irrelevant non wanted artifact

|i was hoping i could wave my hands |um so um |so once wa i i was thinking getting getting us a set of acoustic events to um to be able to distinguish between uh phones and words and stuff |and um once we we would figure out a set of these events that can be you know um hand labeled or or derived uh from h the hand labeled phone targets |um we could take these events and um do some cheating experiments |um where we feed um these events into an sri system um eh and evaluate its performance on a switchboard task

|we we need to to work the the the uh the talkers more |because we 're not gonna have that many meetings
we we need to to work the the the uh the talkers more| because we 're not gonna have that many meetings
|and th you know they get that |and there 's nothing there |so they m s mark it as a breath when it 's really actually nothing |so usually i take those out

|m median |yeah
m Median , yeah .
|yeah |so we talked about getting something together for that |but maybe uh maybe we 'll just put that off for now given that |but i think maybe we should have a a sub meeting |i think |uh probably uh adam and and uh chuck and me should talk about |should get together and talk about that sometime soon

|it 's parsing limitations |i don't want to have this text file that you have to read in the whole thing to do something very simple for
It 's parsing limitations .| I don't want to have this text file that you have to read in the whole thing to do something very simple for .
|or go there |a lot of people ask that if they actually just wanna go there people come up to you on campus and say where 's the library |you 're gonna say y you 're gonna say g go down that way |you 're not gonna say it 's it 's five hundred yards away from you or it 's north of you or it 's located

|but you don't want to just totally excise it |because um uh well you have to be careful about excising it |how how you excise it |keeping the timing right and so forth |so that at the moment tho th the idea we 're running with is is h putting the beep over it

|uh yeah a linux box
Uh , yeah ,| a Linux box .
|right
Right .
|well i have a time mark
Well i have a time mark .
|yeah because there 's only |i mean as andreas pointed out actually i think in the large the larger the group the less interaction the less people are talking um over each other
Yeah because there 's only I mean as Andreas pointed out actually I think in the large the larger the group the less interaction the less people are talking um over each other 
|didn't they also do some kind of an oracle experiment where they said if we could detect the sonorants perfectly and then show how it would improve speech recognition |i thought i remember hearing about an experiment like that

|yeah they didn't go the whole route |did they
Yeah , they didn't go the whole route ,| did they ?
|yeah
Yeah .
|mmm
Mmm .
|maybe
maybe 
|is is this make sense to everybody |yeah |so i don't i don't think it 's worth a lot of work particularly on your part to to to make a big presentation |i don't think you should |you don't have to make any new uh powerpoint or anything |i think we got plenty of stuff to talk about |and then um just see how a discussion goes
Is is this make sense to everybody ?| Yeah .| So , I don't I don't think it 's worth a lot of work , particularly on your part , to to to make a big presentation .| I don't think you should | you don't have to make any new uh PowerPoint or anything .| I think we got plenty of stuff to talk about .| And , then um just see how a discussion goes .
|yeah
Yeah .
|there we go |oh yeah i 'll catch up here |ok |i see
There we go .| Oh , yeah .| I 'll catch up here .| OK , I see .
|right |yeah so we might wanna see if maybe the low sixteen bits on the p z ms are better than the middle sixteen bits |no you don't need to
Right .| Yeah , so we might wanna see if maybe the low sixteen bits on the P Z Ms are better than the middle sixteen bits .| No , you don't need to .
|well it 's around five percent |because it 's s
Well , it 's around five percent , because it 's s
|yeah

|ahh
Ahh .
|i don't think so |it 's it 's better than the net using french spanish and english only trying to tune wha networks
I don't think so .| it 's it 's better than the net using French , Spanish , and English only .| Trying to tune| wha networks ?
|as long as you can regenerate it

|yeah i mean i 'm think if it 's too if it 's too hard for us to annotate the breaths per se we are gonna be building up models for these things
Yeah I mean I 'm think if it 's too if it 's too hard for us to annotate the breaths per se , we are gonna be building up models for these things

|so it 's i
so it 's i
|good

|i don't know at all |but i 've perhaps i have the feeling that it 's something that 's quite quite simple |mmm |yeah |or just like nnn no high pass filter
I don't know at all| but I 've perhaps I have the feeling that it 's something that 's quite quite simple| Mmm , Yeah .| or just like nnn , no high - pass filter
|oh that 's right |yep
Oh , that 's right .| Yep .
|should we be discussing this

|oh they they had some extension that they announced or something
Oh they they had some extension that they announced or something ?
|a a all i 'm saying is that on

|but who knows
but who knows ?
|see you

|here now
Here ?| Now ?
|in term
In term
|do they have to be mutual |yeah |do they have to be mutually exclusive
Do they have to be mutual| Yeah . Do they have to be mutually exclusive ?
|yeah
Yeah .
|that in fact if we made use of the fact that there are two microphones you do have some location information which we don't have with the one |and and so that 's |yeah
that In fact , if we made use of the fact that there are two microphones , you do have some location information . which we don't have with the one| and and so that 's | Yeah .
|the uh
the uh ,
|ok
OK .
|yeah
Yeah .
|but uh ok i was just thinking
But uh OK I was just thinking
|mm hmm
Mm - hmm .
|did you actually look through your transcripts or you just approved them all
Did you actually look through your transcripts ?| Or you just approved them all .
|if i can |if you don't mind my my speaking for you for a bit |um uh
if I can if you don't mind my my speaking for you for a bit , um Uh .
|yeah and that 's
Yeah , and that 's 
|which is smaller |um but maybe |um |so we have a network for the vad which has one hundred hidden units |and the tandem network has five hundred |um so it 's smaller |but th the silence probability from this network seems uh better
Which is smaller ,| Um ,| but maybe ,| um | So we have a network for the VAD which has one hundred hidden units ,| and the tandem network has five hundred .| Um .| So it 's smaller| but th the silence probability from this network seems , uh , better .
|and sometimes it 's hard to tell what the person meant |you know every five words there 'd be something i 'd put in parentheses |cuz i didn't know what it was |are |did they mean uh like they 're pausing
and sometimes it 's hard to tell what the person meant .| You know , every five words there 'd be something I 'd put in parentheses cuz I didn't know what it was .| Are did they mean " uh " like they 're pausing
|yeah
Yeah .
|huh
Huh .
|oh ok
Oh , OK ,
|yes
Yes .
|in albany |yeah |yeah |and uh |yep |that 's it
In Albany ,| yeah .| Yeah .| And uh .| Yep .| That 's it .
|and you c and not all of |no it 's actually digits is only a maybe a fifth of it |the rest is is read is read timit data and uh atis data and wall street journal and stuff like that
And you c| And | Not all of | No it 's actually , digits is only a maybe a fifth of it .| The rest is is read is read TIMIT data and uh ATIS data and Wall Street Journal and stuff like that .
|yeah |and basically the best proposal had something like thirty or forty milliseconds of latency |yeah
Yeah ,| and basically the best proposal had something like thirty or forty milliseconds of latency .| yeah .
|anyway quick question

|hmm
Hmm .
|but um
but Um .
|we are slowly slowly getting to the point where we have uh enough sp room to record meetings |so i uh did a bunch of archiving and still doing a bunch of archiving |i i 'm in the midst of doing the p files from uh broadcast news |and it took eleven hours to do to uh copy it

|but but uh uh dave does have this stuff that is helping on digits |and you know and so with then it 'd be you know just throw that in and see
but but , uh Uh , Dave does have this stuff that is helping on digits ,| and , you know , and so with then it 'd be , you know , just throw that in and see .
|so when we get to that we 'll have some people doing it that know what they 're doing
So , when we get to that we 'll have some people doing it that know what they 're doing .
|and i 'll mention it in my status report if people wanna take a look
And I 'll mention it in my status report if people wanna take a look .
|and the pause is just so the person transcribing it can tell where one line ends and the other begins
And the pause is just so the person transcribing it can tell where one line ends and the other begins .
|and the same is true for the proposal |so you 're also not referring to the width of the object or so
And the same is true for the proposal .| So ,| You 're also not referring to the width of the object , or so ,
|but m i was experimenting with doing this by hand |and i really do think that it 's wise that we 've had them start the way we have with uh m y working off the mixed signal um having the interface that doesn't require them to do the ti uh the time bins for every single channel at a t uh through the entire interaction
But m I was experimenting with doing this by hand| and| I really do think that it 's wise that we 've had them start the way we have| with , uh , m y working off the mixed signal ,| um ,| having the interface that doesn't require them to do the ti uh , the time bins for every single channel at a t uh , through the entire interaction .
|uh so the fourth point is |yeah the timit plus noise seems to be the training set that gives better the best network
Uh , so the fourth point is , yeah , the TIMIT plus noise seems to be the training set that gives better the best network .
|ok |so first decision is we 're gonna anonymize the same name for the speaker identifier and also in the text whenever the speaker 's name is mentioned
OK , so first decision is , we 're gonna anonymize the same name for the speaker identifier and also in the text whenever the speaker 's name is mentioned .

Oh !| We could we look 
|especially as you get en more voices |the first meeting had i think just four people
Especially as you get , en more voices .| The first meeting had I think just four people ,
|as well as the close talking mikes what the close talk ng talking mikes gives us is some ground truth gives us um high quality audio |um especially for people who aren't interested in the acoustic parts of this corpus |so for people who are more interested in language we didn't want to penalize them by having only the far field mikes available |and then also um it 's a very very hard task in terms of speech recognition |um and so uh on the far field mikes we can expect very low recognition results |so we wanted the near field mikes to at least isolate the difference between the two so that 's why we 're recording in parallel with the close talking and the far field at the same time and then all these channels are recorded simultaneously and framed synchronously so that you can also do things like um beam forming on all the microphones and do research like that our intention is to release this data to the public um probably through f through a body like the ldc

|in each set you have a range of conditions |well
in each set you have a range of conditions | Well

|i mean the tcl tk overhead is pretty high |but it shouldn't matter
I mean the Tcl - TK overhead is pretty high ,| but it shouldn't matter .
|yeah
Yeah .
|so so i think using a a good aligner um actually can can help a lot |um |but uh you know they both help each other |if you have a if you have a better starting point then it helps the aligner |if you have a good alignment it helps the uh th the human in in taking less time to correct things |because ultimately we 're gonna end up with some s su kind of structure like that |so so
So so I think using a a good aligner , um , actually can can help a lot .| Um .

|where 'd you get the digits from
Where 'd you get the digits from ?
|yes |um the lda filter needs some training set to obtain the filter |maybe i don't know exactly how they are obtained
Yes ,| um the LDA filter needs some training set to obtain the filter .| Maybe| I don't know exactly how they are obtained .
|does anybody have anything else to |shall we read some digits

the same cle
|i would say that tha that those discussions have been primarily um keith and keith and me |but um
I would say that tha that those discussions have been primarily , um , Keith and Keith and me ,| but um
|well you might be right |that mi might be the way at getting at what i was talking about |but the particular reason why i was interested in doing that was because i remember when that happened |and john ohala was over here |and he was looking at the spectrograms of the more difficult ones |uh he didn't know what to say about what is the sequence of phones |there |they came up with some compromise |because that really wasn't what it look like

|and but
And .| But .
|yeah c
Yeah ,| c
|if i look at my wristwatch when i say that it 's about two seconds
if I look at my wristwatch when I say that it 's about two seconds .
|so
so .
|five five
Five , five .
|it 's |yeah it seems to be more at the end
It 's yeah , it seems to be more at the end .
|no i 'm sorry |ru running on what machine
No ,| I 'm sorry ,| ru running on what machine ?
|but when i wanna expand a timebin back
but when I wanna expand a timebin back
|ok
OK .
|mm hmm
Mm - hmm .
|and so now i 'm you can run stuff on that |and that really helps a lot |because now we 've got you know extra machines that we can use for compute |yeah he suggested a smaller capacitor
and so now I 'm you can run stuff on that and that really helps a lot because now we 've got you know , extra machines that we can use for compute .| Yeah , he suggested a smaller capacitor ,
|on the sri system |but we could give it a try

|ok
OK .
|i don't know
I don't know .
|yeah
Yeah ,
|mm hmm
Mm - hmm ,

|mm hmm
Mm - hmm .
|another node on what
Another node on what ?
|yeah |ok
Yeah . OK .
|that 's true
That 's true .
|yeah
Yeah .
|and you can't you can't access that |so you have to install first install tcl then install snack
and you can't you can't access that| so you have to install First install Tcl then install Snack
|no i like the idea of putting down the the status information |because i think you probably can get a lot of interest |there |can be a lot of interesting research on that
No , I like the idea of putting down the the status information| because I think you probably can get a lot of interest there can be a lot of interesting research on that .
|it 's a hard puzzle
It 's a hard puzzle .
|and and they 're not gonna provide they 're not gonna provide stress |they 're not gonna re provide repairs |they 're not gonna provide they they may or may not provide speaker id |so that we would have to do our own tools to do that
And and they 're not gonna provide they 're not gonna provide stress ,| they 're not gonna re provide repairs ,| they 're not gonna provide | they they may or may not provide speaker ID .| So that we would have to do our own tools to do that .
|and just clip it to your collar
And just clip it to your collar .
|mm hmm
Mm - hmm .
|ok |great
OK , great .
|that is really great
That is really great .
|uh
Uh .
|so if if we 're right you can get by with um just this middle column worth of decisions |and it 's not all that many |and it 's perfectly feasible technically to build belief nets that will do that |and he has a handout
So if if we 're right , you can get by with um just this middle column worth of decisions ,| and it 's not all that many , and it 's perfectly feasible technically to build belief - nets that will do that .| And he has a handout .
|does that 's |yeah
Does | That 's | Yeah .
|then you have like subliminal uh messages
Then you have , like , subliminal , uh , messages ,
|before the a
Before the A .
|we just want to know how we should answer where is x
We just want to know how we should answer " Where is X ? "
|yep
Yep .
|oh you 're a
Oh , you 're a 
|yeah |yeah |yeah |cuz our sense from the other from the aurora uh task is that
Yeah .| Yeah .| Yeah .| Cuz our sense from the other from the Aurora , uh , task is that 
|i b my guess is it 's gonna be ten people
I b My guess is it 's gonna be ten .| People 
|is it because

|yeah
Yeah .
|and um
and um
|of the speaker id or something
Of the speaker ID or something ?
|but that 's g that 's as far as i can tell it 's it 's putting together two real hard problems |one is the linguistic part of what are the couplings |and and when you have a certain uh construction that implies certain couplings and other couplings you know between let 's say between the past and the present or any other one of these things

|um so giving them you think a web site to say if you wanna print it out here it is is not sufficient
Um . So giving them , you think a web site to say , " if you wanna print it out here it is " , is not sufficient ?
|there it is
there it is .
|like frication
like frication ,
|we had reached the point where um on the male portion of the development set the um or one of the development sets i should say the um the male error rate with uh icsi plp features was pretty much identical with uh sri features which are mfcc |so um then i thought oh great |i 'll j i 'll just let 's make sure everything works on the females |and the error rate |you know there was a three percent difference

|oh oh
Oh , oh .
|you know um caused motion |i don't know |something like that
you know , um , " Caused motion " ,| I don't know ,| something like that .
|so you know as as the smartkom people have this is sort of their standard demo dialogue |which is you know what the system survives and nothing but that

|however uh some old uh wavelans are also |but not the older ones |the oldest ones are also uh two point four m eh gigahertz s
However , uh some old uh waveLANs are also , but not the older ones the oldest ones , are also uh two point four m| eh gigahertz . S
|yeah |uh there was a p problem that we observed um that there was there were like many insertions in the in the system
Yeah . Uh , there was a p problem that we observed , um , that there was there were , like , many insertions in the in the system .
|so that 's probably the next step
So that 's probably the next step ,
|yep |the aurora |there 's a special aurora
Yep . The Aurora there 's a special Aurora 
|yeah
Yeah .
|can i see it

|i mean that you have eh you have a backchannel |eh eh you have a overlapping zone |very short
I mean that you have eh you have a backchannel , eh , eh you have a overlapping zone very short
|but i think |yeah i think the reason is |yeah |i not i it was in my mail i think also is the fact that the mismatch is trained only on the far microphone
But . I think ,| yeah .| I think the reason is ,| yeah , I not I | it was in my mail I think also , is the fact that the mismatch is trained only on the far microphone .
|yeah |would it |i mean |but when you 're saying second you 're comparing to the numbers that the uh that the best system before got on uh also without german and danish
Yeah .| Would it I mean But | When you 're saying second , you 're comparing to the numbers that the , uh that the best system before got on , uh also without German and Danish ?
|uh
Uh .
|so you you run with three two two five |that 's a
So you you run with three , two , two , five ? That 's a
|anyway shall we do digits

|oh that 's right |i remember |yeah
Oh , that 's right .| I remember .| Yeah .
|so that 's my future uh forecast
So , that 's my future uh forecast .
|so you 'll suddenly have this stranded word out in the middle of nowhere |and it 's because this other speaker on this other channel was trying to formulate this thought |and they paused |and they paused just enough that this person leaped in and gave them a word
So you 'll suddenly have this stranded word out in the middle of nowhere , and it 's because| this other speaker on this other channel was trying to formulate this thought , and they paused ,| and they paused just enough that this person leaped in and gave them a word .

|mm hmm
Mm - hmm .
|this is something we did for the maestro project uh for for rick

|hmm
Hmm .
|they 'll see by example |yeah that 's i think that 's fine
They 'll see by example .| Yeah that 's I think that 's fine ,
|so hang on so that would |ok

|hmm
Hmm .
|the energy

|oh like kind of kind of laughing with it
Oh , like kind of kind of laughing with it
|well although we wanted to get alignments from the close mike stuff
Well , although we wanted to get alignments from the close mike stuff .
|the we got to the point where we can now speak into the smartkom system |and it 'll go all the way through and then say something like roman numeral one am smarticus

|ca can you run the sri just as an experiment run the sri front end without vocal tract norma normalization and see how much difference it makes
Ca - can you run the SRI Just as an experiment , run the SRI front - end without vocal tract norma normalization , and see how much difference it makes ?
|ok
OK .
|i should 've sent email and i haven't yet

|and we haven't looked at it for digits
and we haven't looked at it for digits ,
|speaker id |yeah |well there 're different ways of thinking about it
Speaker ID .| Yeah .| Well , there 're different ways of thinking about it .
|and i tried both means adaptation and means and variances
And I tried both means adaptation and means and variances ,
|uh not really
Uh not really .
|well that that |yeah th there 's one of the advantages of a document |right
Well that that yeah th there 's one of the advantages of a document , right ? ,
|mm hmm
Mm - hmm .
|so so so one thing is yeah talk about demo
So So so , one thing is , yeah , talk about demo ,
|using the clean filter
Using the clean filter .
|nuh |but the entrance where you actually wanna go is somewhere completely different |so unless you 're a mail person you really don't wanna go there
Nuh ?| but the entrance where you actually wanna go is somewhere completely different .| So unless you 're a mail person you really don't wanna go there .
|so
So .
|right
Right .
|he wrote a paper about thirty five years ago on that one
He wrote a paper about thirty - five years ago on that one .
|yep
Yep .
|yeah
yeah .
|mmm
Mmm .
|so
So .
|right
Right .
|well i i do think that this this will be a doable procedure
Well , I I do think that this this will be a doable procedure ,
|but then sometimes they transcribe it like so that would be a problem |period new word like capitalized |so
But then sometimes they transcribe it like " So that would be a problem " , period , new word , like capitalized " So " .
|right
Right ?
|do you see what i mean
Do you see what I mean ?
|fri
Fri
|yep
Yep .
|so
So 
|i don't know |i would not be as thorough not be as careful
I don't know ,| I would not be as thorough ,| not be as careful .
|should we do uh simultaneous digits so that we actually have time for tea
Should we do , uh , simultaneous digits so that we actually have time for tea ?
|the other side is |yeah
the other side is , yeah .
|ok |yeah that 's right
OK ,| yeah , that 's right .
|i think i have a pair that i brought from home
I think I have a pair that I brought from home ,
|now would the ones that um are already transcribed |we h we have enough there that c you know we 've already done some studies and so forth |or
Now would the ones that , um , are already transcribed we h we have enough there that c| you know , we 've already done some studies and so forth| or ?
|for this case |right
For this case , right ?
|but if he g if he turns is is really gonna turn around and help t to write this version that does connect with as many as possible of the other linguists in the world |um then then it becomes important to use terminology that doesn't make it hard
But if he g if he turns is is really gonna turn around and help t to write this version that does connect with as many as possible of the other linguists in the world um then then it becomes important to use terminology that doesn't make it hard 
|yeah
Yeah .
|mm hmm
Mm - hmm .
|good
Good .
|so they 're still working
So they 're still working .
|i mean the means of what
I mean , the means of what ?
|yeah
Yeah .
|yeah
Yeah .
|that 's always a good way to begin |yeah |yeah
That 's always a good way to begin . Yeah . Yeah .
|right
Right .
|yeah
Yeah .
|yeah |and if it changes to point five point five which is equal @ @ for transition and self loop where it becomes eighty eight percent
Yeah .| And if it changes to point five point five , which is equal @ @ for transition and self loop where it becomes eighty - eight percent .
|and so but it 's it 's doing something very very simple |it just takes a threshold based on on the volume
and so but it 's it 's doing something very , very simple .| It just takes a threshold , based on on the volume ,
|and the other one is for the distant microphone which has more noise |so
And the other one is for the distant microphone| which has more noise| so ,
|yeah the main thing that struck me in looking at those two spectrograms was the difference in the high frequencies it looked like for the one that was farther away |you know it really everything was attenuated |yeah |and
Yeah .| The main thing that struck me in looking at those two spectrograms was the difference in the high frequencies .| It looked like for the one that was farther away , you know , it really everything was attenuated| Yeah .| and 
|right |i i think uh
Right .| I I think , uh 
|um oh before you l go
Um , oh , before you l go 
|yeah you could even then to to get an idea about how different it is you could maybe take some subset and you know go through a few sentences |mark them by hand
Yeah , you could even then to to get an idea about how different it is , you could maybe take some subset and you know , go through a few sentences , mark them by hand
|ah right |it 's just like defined by the acoustics
Ah , right !| It 's just , like , defined by the acoustics .
|uh huh |but that 's
Uh - huh .| But that 's 
|so i mean it 's it 's common that people do this sort of thing where they do more things that are more complex or require looking over more time whatever in some kind of second pass
So I mean , it 's it 's common that people do this sort of thing where they do more things that are more complex or require looking over more time , whatever , in some kind of second pass .
|yeah
Yeah .
|yeah yeah yeah
Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .
|but the university of hawaii has issued a request
But the University of Hawaii has issued a request .
|yeah i was wondering uh you know what size net |i should anybody have any intuitions or suggestions
Yeah .| I was wondering uh you know what size net I should | Anybody have any intuitions or suggestions ?
|ok |it 's very disgust
OK .| It 's very disgust
|yeah but you know what
Yeah ,| but you know what ?
|well it is there 's another case where i ran across like o of that type |um i when i was sitting here and we were doing this was like o one of the first meetings i ever participated in |and and dan was adjusting something here |and adam was in the next room |and um adam says so i 'll come in here and check the levels |and and he says something you 're not going on simply the auditory |there 's a huge contribution from the top down processing |and dan says no |and it sounds like he 's saying no to adam |and it was w if if if so this would have been extremely rude
Well , it is There 's another case where I ran across like o of that type ,| um , i when I was sitting here and we were doing | This was like o one of the first meetings I ever participated in| and and Dan was adjusting something here| and Adam was in the next room ,| and , um , Adam says , " So I 'll come in here and check the levels , "| and and he says something| You 're not going on simply the auditory there 's a huge contribution from the top - down processing ,| and Dan says , " No " .| And it sounds like he 's saying " no " to Adam ,| and it was w if if if so , this would have been extremely rude .
|so that that 's uh
So that that 's , uh 
|well well chafe had this wor |i think it was chafe or somebody had a the word spurt originally
Well , well , Chafe had this wor I think it was Chafe , or somebody had a the word " spurt " originally ,
|did you guys ever when this happened to me when i first started transcribing |cuz i had never really transcribed stuff like this before
Did you guys ever ,| when This happened to me when I first started transcribing ,| cuz I had never really transcribed stuff like this before ,
|mm hmm |yeah |so um there is uh these parameters that i still have to to look at |like i played a little bit with this overestimation factor |uh but i still have to to look more at this |um at the level of noise i add after |uh i know that adding noise helped um the system just using spectral subtraction without smoothing |but i don't know right now if it 's still important or not |and if the level i choose before is still the right one
Mm - hmm .| Yeah .| So ,| um ,| there is uh , these parameters that I still have to to look at .| Like , I played a little bit with this overestimation factor ,| uh ,| but I still have to to look more at this ,| um ,| at the level of noise I add after . Uh , I know that adding noise helped , um , the system just using spectral subtraction without smoothing ,| but I don't know right now if it 's still important or not , and if the level I choose before is still the right one .
|i mean the normalization you do is over the whole conversation
I mean , the normalization you do is over the whole conversation
|right
right ?
|right
Right .
|ok |uh our approach is you know we do whatever is necessary to do it |and you know some of it may go into something depending on you know your scalable power
OK ,| uh , our approach is , you know , we do whatever is necessary to do it| and , you know , some of it may go into something , depending on , you know , your scalable power .
|yeah
Yeah .
|oh discourse
Oh , discourse .
|yeah |so i mean it 's a bit of a push |but it seems like ok |we 've got some models |we 've got some training data |we have software that works |he 's got a method that helps with you know other ta another task |um it you know appears to be you know debugged
Yeah . So , I mean , it 's a bit of a push ,| but it seems like ,| OK , we 've got some models ,| we 've got some training data , we have software that works , he 's got a method that helps with , you know , other ta another task .| Um | It , you know , appears to be , you know , debugged .
|and the uh aurora htk it was like twenty
And the , uh , Aurora HTK , it was like twenty .
|ok
OK .
|it 's just for the research to continue the research on the meeting recorder stuff
It 's just for the research | to continue the research on the Meeting Recorder stuff ?
|oh i mean i don't know |did we s did we spend our the budget already that we had
Oh I mean , I don't know .| Did we s did we spend our the budget already that we had ?
|yeah
Yeah .
|so i guess this is more or less now just to get you up to date |johno |ok
So I guess this is more or less now just to get you up to date , Johno .| OK .
|mmm
Mmm .
|yeah that 's all
Yeah , that 's all .
|now that we have the data and we have the alignment
now that we have the data and we have the alignment ,
|but not much on the in the other cases
But not much on the in the other cases .
|um any more on transcript we wanna talk about
Um , any more on transcript we wanna talk about ?
|right
Right .
|yeah i agree |i agree i agree
Yeah I agree I agree . I agree .
|right |if you say that 's more their in general what their background is
Right ?| If you say that 's more their in general what their background is .
|and then i 'll be
And then I 'll be 
|n no
n No .
|same idea
Same idea ?
|no it was
no it was 
|hmm
Hmm .
|oh ok |ok you didn't tell me that |ok that 's fine
Oh , OK . OK . You didn't tell me that .| OK , that 's fine .
|d uh does it have a speaker
D uh does it have a speaker ?
|oh he he he used the identical pruning thresholds |even though the s the range of p of the likeli
Oh !| He he He used the identical pruning thresholds even though the s the range of p of the likeli
|um
um ,
|it 's a little bit better for me too
It 's a little bit better for me too
|i don't
I don't 
|um |yeah not better not worse
Um Yeah , not better , not worse .
|i i personally i 'd i 'm not in favor of more meetings |um because uh
I I Personally I 'd I 'm not in favor of more meetings .| Um . Because , uh .
|they actually are |uh it 's just a single s uh you know a single phone in the pronunciation
They actually are | uh , it 's just a single , s uh , you know , a single phone in the pronunciation ,
|i don't really see the people at uw that i know of right now making huge amoun investing huge amounts of time in changing transcripts |but i could be wrong
I don't really see the people at UW that I know of right now making huge amoun investing huge amounts of time in changing transcripts .| But I could be wrong .
|right |yeah |well yeah most of the time when we 're listening to other people 's speech we 're just trying to get the gist not literally what people are saying
Right . Yeah well , yeah , most of the time when we 're listening to other people 's speech , we 're just trying to get the gist .| Not literally what people are saying

|um but the p the |anyway so the thing is i uh d naively speaking you 've you 've got a for this little task a belief net which is going to have as output the conditional pr probability of one of three things that the person wants to uh to view it to enter it or to tango with it |um so that the the output of the belief net is pretty well formed |and then the inputs are going to be these kinds of things |and then the question is there are two questions is uh one where do you get this i information from |and two what 's the structure of the belief net so what are the conditional probabilities of this that and the other given these things and you probably need intermediate nodes i we don't know what they are yet so it may well be that uh for example that uh knowing whether oh another thing you want is some information abou i think about the time of day ok well we can start doing it now they may wanna call that part of context but the time of day matters a lot

|i mean it 's probably more than that |but but with of of non digits

|you know so region with respect to a time frame is what i would suggest |where did you live |i mean what you said you know where where wh where did you live or uh what you were saying languages in the home |but i think that uh a time frame on the region would be useful instead of region |now say it 's a little bit unbounded

|i mean i have i 've i 've observed there are like a lot of bumps in the frequency when i do this wiener filtering |which is more like a musical noise or something |and so by adding another stage of wiener filtering the results on the speechdat car was like um so i still don't have the word error rate

|and then we wanted to s just limit it to maybe uh something on the same order of dimensions as we use in a standard um front end |so that would mean just doing the top i don't know ten or twelve or something of the klt dimensions
And then we wanted to s just limit it to maybe uh something on the same order of dimensions as we use in a standard um front - end .| So that would mean just doing the top I don't know ten or twelve or something of the KLT dimensions .

|and uh similar similar amount of data to what you 're talking about with timit training |so it seems to me that the only reasonable starting point is uh to automatically translate the uh current timit markings into the markings you want |right |and uh it won't have the kind of characteristic that you 'd like of catching funny kind of things that maybe aren't there from these automatic markings

|oh how interesting

|yeah
Yeah ,
|what i i think you know in most meetings this one being different |but in most meetings that i attend there 's somebody t explicitly taking notes frequently on a laptop |um you can just make it be on a laptop

|but you do in the others too |so
But you do in the others , too . So .
|so uh the question is how complex a function do you need |do you need to have an added layer or something |in which case uh potentially you know it could be big
So , uh , the question is , how complex a function do you need ?| Do you need to have an added layer or something ?| In which case , uh , potentially , you know , it could be big .

|february sixteenth i think

|but there the main point is that um you know it took us a while |but we have the procedure for coupling the two systems debugged now |and i mean there 's still conceivably some bug somewhere in the way we 're feeding the tandem features
But there the main point is that , um , you know , it took us a while but we have the procedure for coupling the two systems debugged now| and I mean , there 's still conceivably some bug somewhere in the way we 're feeding the tandem features 
|although they did put a missing segment |so sometimes in brackets
Although , they did put a " missing segment " so sometimes in brackets .
|yeah it doesn't give the punch line
yeah , it doesn't give the punch line .
|right
Right .
|so we could try that with this particular twenty minutes of speech and sort of see if there 's any differences

|do you hafta do some kind of uh low pass filter before you do that

|now is ti di is is that part of the result that they get for the uh development |th the results that they 're supposed to get at the end of end of the month |the ti digits are there also
Now is TI di is is that part of the result that they get for the uh development th the results that they 're supposed to get at the end of end of the month , the TI - digits are there also ?
|uh so um what i was asking though is uh are what 's what 's the level of communication with uh the o g i gang now about this |and

|so i so it it 's it 's a good wake up call if people |well we have this performance |but you have to keep in mind we 're doing we 're we 're not doing the whole real task in this way and this way and this way |but i 'll convince you that that it 's still important for you to listen to what i have to say next because of this and this |right |right

|oh let 's let 's |i mean i think that as as we said before that one of the things that we 're imagining is that uh there there will be uh in the system we end up with there 'll be something to explicitly uh uh do something about noise

|but i think it 'd be great i to be able to compare digits whether it 's these digits or ti digits to speakers |um and compare that to their spontaneous speech |and then we do need you know a fair amount of of digit data |because you might be wearing a different microphone |and i mean so it 's it 's nice to have the digits you know replicated many times
