6	cool	_
7	we	BeginSeg=Yes
8	could	_

5	days	_
6	we	BeginSeg=Yes
7	were	_
8	in	_
9	Portland	_
10	,	_
11	we	BeginSeg=Yes
12	went	_
13	hiking	_
14	in	_
15	Forest	_
16	Park	_
17	which	BeginSeg=Yes
18	you	_
19	can	_
20	get	_
21	to	_
22	by	_
23	public	_
24	transit	_
25	in	_
26	the	_
27	city	_
28	.	_

1	It's	_
2	It	BeginSeg=Yes
3	's	_
4	really	_
5	quick	_
6	and	BeginSeg=Yes
7	some	_
8	of	_
9	the	_
10	trails	_
11	even	_
12	pop	_
13	you	_
14	back	_
15	out	_
16	into	_
17	like	_
18	the	_
19	city	_
20	,	_
21	so	BeginSeg=Yes
22	it's	_
23	it	_
24	's	_
25	–	_
26	it's	_
27	it	BeginSeg=Yes
28	's	_
29	really	_
30	super	_
31	accessible	_
32	.	_

1	So	BeginSeg=Yes
2	we	_
3	did	_
4	the	_
5	Wildwood	_
6	Trail	_
7	and	BeginSeg=Yes
8	we	_
9	also	_
10	did	_
11	a	_
12	tour	_
13	of	_
14	Pittock	_
15	Mansion	_
16	.	_

1	Um	BeginSeg=Yes
2	if	_
3	you	_
4	don't	_
5	do	_
6	n't	_
7	want	_
8	to	_
9	do	_
10	a	_
11	tour	_
12	of	_
13	Pittock	_
14	Mansion	_
15	,	_
16	I'd	_
17	I	BeginSeg=Yes
18	'd	_
19	still	_
20	recommend	_
21	like	_
22	taking	_
23	the	_
24	trail	_
25	up	_
26	there	_
27	because	BeginSeg=Yes
28	it	_
29	has	_
30	a	_
31	really	_
32	cool	_
33	like	_
34	overlook	_
35	of	_
36	the	_
37	city	_
38	that	BeginSeg=Yes
39	you	_
40	can	_
41	go	_
42	see	_
43	.	_

1	Um	BeginSeg=Yes
2	I	_
3	loved	_
4	doing	_
5	that	_
6	.	_

1	So	BeginSeg=Yes
2	number	_
3	four	_
4	are	_
5	the	_
6	Japanese	_
7	gardens	_
8	and	_
9	the	_
10	rose	_
11	gardens	_
12	in	_
13	Forest	_
14	Park	_
15	.	_

1	I	BeginSeg=Yes
2	actually	_
3	don't	_
4	do	_
5	n't	_
6	know	_
7	if	BeginSeg=Yes
8	they	_
9	're	_
10	like	_
11	technically	_
12	in	_
13	Forest	_
14	Park	_
15	but	BeginSeg=Yes
16	they	_
17	're	_
18	right	_
19	in	_
20	the	_
21	same	_
22	area	_
23	.	_

1	So	BeginSeg=Yes
2	the	_
3	rose	_
4	garden	_
5	is	_
6	free	_
7	and	_
8	open	_
9	to	_
10	the	_
11	public	_
12	and	BeginSeg=Yes
13	it	_
14	is	_
15	just	_
16	huge	_
17	.	_

1	It's	_
2	It	BeginSeg=Yes
3	's	_
4	a	_
5	lot	_
6	of	_
7	roses	_
8	as	BeginSeg=Yes
9	you	_
10	can	_
11	imagine	_
12	.	_

1	Um	BeginSeg=Yes
2	lots	_
3	of	_
4	tourists	_
5	but	BeginSeg=Yes
6	it	_
7	was	_
8	–	_
9	it	_
10	was	_
11	still	_
12	really	_
13	fun	_

21	yeah	_
22	it	_
23	was	_
24	just	_
25	really	_

4	gardens	_
5	you	_
6	do	_
7	have	_
8	to	_
9	pay	_

16	it	_
17	was	_
18	definitely	_
19	worth	_
20	it	_

1	So	BeginSeg=Yes
2	we	_
3	are	_
4	going	_

6	do	_
7	a	_
8	week	_
9	of	BeginSeg=Yes

29	today	_
30	I'm	_
31	I	_
32	'm	_
33	on	_
34	general	_
35	nuclear	_
36	medicine	_
37	,	_
38	so	BeginSeg=Yes
39	let's	_
40	let	_
41	's	_
42	start	_
43	the	_
44	day	_
45	.	_

1	So	BeginSeg=Yes
2	like	BeginSeg=Yes
3	I	_
4	said	_
5	,	_
6	I'm	_
7	I	BeginSeg=Yes
8	'm	_
9	on	_
10	my	_
11	general	_
12	nuclear	_
13	medicine	_
14	rotation	_
15	this	_
16	week	_
17	.	_

1	I	BeginSeg=Yes
2	get	_
3	switched	_
4	around	_
5	--	_
6	moved	BeginSeg=Yes
7	around	_
8	a	_
9	few	_
10	times	_
11	to	BeginSeg=Yes
12	cover	_
13	some	_
14	residents	_
15	who	BeginSeg=Yes
16	are	_
17	on	_
18	vacation	_
19	,	_
20	so	BeginSeg=Yes
21	I'll	_
22	I	_

25	at	_
26	other	_
27	spots	_
28	later	_
29	this	_
30	week	_
31	.	_

1	So	BeginSeg=Yes
2	so	_
3	far	_
4	this	_
5	morning	_
6	I've	_
7	I	_
8	've	_
9	just	_
10	read	_
11	a	_
12	few	_
13	studies	_
14	(	BeginSeg=Yes
15	it's	_
16	it	_
17	's	_
18	a	_
19	little	_
20	slow	_
21	in	_
22	the	_
23	morning	_
24	)	_
25	of	BeginSeg=Yes
26	general	_
27	nuclear	_
28	medicine	_
29	because	BeginSeg=Yes
30	a	_
31	lot	_
32	of	_
33	stuff	_
34	takes	_
35	time	_
36	for	BeginSeg=Yes
37	the	_
38	radio	_
39	tracers	_
40	to	_
41	go	_
42	into	_
43	the	_
44	body	_
45	or	_
46	the	_
47	specific	_
48	organ	_
49	we	BeginSeg=Yes
50	are	_
51	targeting	_
52	,	_
53	so	BeginSeg=Yes
54	we	_
55	have	_
56	to	_
57	wait	_
58	a	_
59	little	_
60	bit	_
61	in	_
62	the	_
63	morning	_
64	.	_

1	So	BeginSeg=Yes
2	I've	_
3	I	_
4	've	_
5	done	_
6	three	_
7	lymphoscintigraphies	_
8	.	_

1	For	BeginSeg=Yes
2	lymphoscintigraphies	_
3	we	_
4	basically	_
5	inject	_
6	technetium	_
7	in	_
8	skin	_
9	surrounding	BeginSeg=Yes
10	a	_
11	melanoma	_
12	and	BeginSeg=Yes
13	after	_
14	we	_
15	inject	_
16	we	BeginSeg=Yes
17	wait	_
18	about	_
19	15	_
20	-	_
21	20	_
22	minutes	_
23	,	_
24	maybe	BeginSeg=Yes
25	up	_
26	to	_
27	an	_
28	hour	_
29	,	_
30	and	BeginSeg=Yes
31	wait	_
32	for	_
33	that	_
34	radio	_
35	tracer	_
36	to	_
37	travel	_
38	to	_
39	the	_
40	closest	_
41	lymph	_
42	node	_
43	which	BeginSeg=Yes
44	we	_
45	would	_
46	call	_
47	the	_
48	sentinel	_
49	lymph	_
50	node	_
51	.	_

1	What	BeginSeg=Yes
2	we	_
3	do	_
4	is	BeginSeg=Yes
5	we	_
6	mark	_
7	it	_
8	under	_
9	our	_
10	cameras	_
11	and	BeginSeg=Yes
12	then	_
13	the	_
14	patient	_
15	will	_
16	go	_
17	up	_
18	to	_
19	the	_
20	OR	_
21	,	_
22	have	BeginSeg=Yes
23	the	_
24	melanoma	_
25	,	_
26	a	_
27	wide	_
28	excision	_
29	of	_
30	the	_
31	melanoma	_
32	,	_
33	and	BeginSeg=Yes
34	then	_
35	they	_
36	will	_
37	try	_
38	to	_
39	find	_
40	the	_
41	lymph	_
42	node	_
43	that	BeginSeg=Yes
44	we	_
45	marked	_
46	and	BeginSeg=Yes
47	take	_
48	that	_
49	one	_
50	out	_
51	as	_
52	well	_
53	to	BeginSeg=Yes
54	make	_
55	sure	_
56	there's	_
57	there	_
58	's	_
59	no	_
60	metastasis	_
61	.	_

1	So	BeginSeg=Yes
2	I've	_
3	I	_
4	've	_
5	done	_
6	three	_
7	of	_
8	those	_
9	this	_
10	morning	_
11	.	_

1	I	BeginSeg=Yes
2	will	_
3	read	_
4	a	_
5	few	_
6	more	_
7	scans	_
8	coming	BeginSeg=Yes
9	up	_
10	here	_
11	shortly	_

15	to	_
16	tie	_
17	up	_
18	some	_
19	loose	_

25	conference	_
26	.	_

1	I'll	_
2	I	BeginSeg=Yes

2	get	_
3	to	_
4	head	_
5	home	_
6	early	_
7	today	_
8	because	BeginSeg=Yes
9	we	_
10	finished	_
